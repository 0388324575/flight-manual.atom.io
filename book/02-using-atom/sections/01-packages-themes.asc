=== Atom Packages

First we'll start with the Atom package system. As we mentioned previously, Atom itself is a very basic core of functionality that ships with a number of useful packages that add new features like the Tree view and the Settings view (which, by the way, can be found here: https://github.com/atom/settings-view).

In fact, there are more than 70 packages that comprise all of the functionality that is available in Atom by default. As some examples, the Welcome dialog that you see when you first start it (https://github.com/atom/welcome), the spell checker (https://github.com/atom/spell-check), the themes (https://github.com/atom/atom-dark-ui) and the fuzzy finder (https://github.com/atom/fuzzy-finder) are all packages that are seperately maintained and all use the same APIs that you have access to, as we'll see in great detail in <<_hacking_atom>>.

This means that packages can be incredibly powerful and can change everything from the very look and feel of the entire interface to the basic operation of even core functionality.

In order to install a new package, you can use the Packages tab in the now familiar Settings view. Simply open up the Settings view (`cmd-,`) and type your seach query into the box under Install Packages that hints ``Search Packages''. This will go to the atom.io package registry and pull in anything that matches your search terms.

Most of the packages will come up with an ``Install'' button. Clicking that will download the package and install it and your editor will start having this functionality.
