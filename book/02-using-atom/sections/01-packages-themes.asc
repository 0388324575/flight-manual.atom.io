=== Atom Packages

First we'll start with the Atom package system. As we mentioned previously, Atom itself is a very basic core of functionality that ships with a number of useful packages that add new features like the Tree view and the Settings view (which, by the way, can be found here: https://github.com/atom/settings-view).

In fact, there are more than 70 packages that comprise all of the functionality that is available in Atom by default. As some examples, the https://github.com/atom/welcome[Welcome dialog] that you see when you first start it, the https://github.com/atom/spell-check[spell checker], the https://github.com/atom/atom-dark-ui[themes] and the https://github.com/atom/fuzzy-finder[fuzzy finder] are all packages that are seperately maintained and all use the same APIs that you have access to, as we'll see in great detail in <<_hacking_atom>>.

This means that packages can be incredibly powerful and can change everything from the very look and feel of the entire interface to the basic operation of even core functionality.

In order to install a new package, you can use the Packages tab in the now familiar Settings view. Simply open up the Settings view (`cmd-,`), click on the ``Packages'' tab and type your seach query into the box under Install Packages that hints ``Search Packages''. This will go to the atom.io package registry and pull in anything that matches your search terms.

All of the packages will come up with an ``Install'' button. Clicking that will download the package and install it and your editor will now start having this functionality.

==== Package Settings

Once a package is installed in Atom, it will show up in the side pane in your setting screen, along with all the preinstalled packages that come with Atom. To filter the list in order to find one, you can type into the ``Filter packages'' textbox.

Clicking on one of the package names will give you the settings screen for the package. Here you have the option of changing some of the default variables for the package, seeing what all the command keybindings are, disabling the package temporarily, looking at the source code, seeing the current version of the package, reporting issues and uninstalling the package.

If a new version of any of your packages is released, Atom will automatically detect it and you can upgrade the package from either this screen or from the main package search tab. This helps you easily keep all your installed packages up to date.

=== Atom Themes

You can also find and install new themes for Atom from the Settings view. These can be either UI themes or syntax highlighting themes and you can search for them from the ``Themes'' tab, just like searching for new packages.

Clicking on the ``Learn More'' button on any of the themes will take you to a profile page for the theme on atom.io where there is nearly always a screenshot for seeing what the theme looks like.

Clicking on ``Install'' will install the theme and make it available in the Theme dropdowns as we saw in  <<_color_themes>>.
