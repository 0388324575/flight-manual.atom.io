=== Folding

You can fold blocks of code by clicking the arrows that appear when you hover your mouse cursor over the gutter. You can also fold and unfold from the keyboard with `alt-cmd-[` and `alt-cmd-]`. To fold everything, use `alt-cmd-shift-{` and to unfold everything use `alt-cmd-shift-}`. You can also fold at a specific indentation level with `cmd-k cmd-N` where N is the indentation depth.


[[_atom_panes]]
=== Panes

You can split any editor pane horizontally or vertically by using `cmd-k right` or `cmd-k down`. Once you have a split pane, you can move focus between them with `cmd-k cmd-right` or `cmd-k cmd-down`. To close a pane, close all its editors with `cmd-w`, then press `cmd-w` one more time to close the pane. You can configure panes to auto-close when empty in the Settings view.
