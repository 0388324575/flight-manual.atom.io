=== Working with Text

OK, so now we've got our

* line manipulation (indent, goto)

`cntl-cmd-up`, `cntl-cmd-down` - moves lines up and down

* case, delete, transpose
* recording and replaying
* change encoding, grammar
* bracket matching
* multiple cursors
    - cmd-shift-L (selection to cursors)
    - cntl-shift-up (add cursor up/down)
* whitespace
* spell checking


==== Wrapping Text

If you want to toggle soft wrap, trigger the command from the command palette. Press `cmd-shift-P` to open the palette, then type "wrap" to find the correct command. By default, lines will wrap based on the size of the editor. If you prefer to wrap at a specific line length, toggle "Wrap at preferred line length" in preferences.

==== Navigating by Symbols

To jump to a symbol such as a method definition, press `cmd-r`. This opens a list of all symbols in the current file, which you can fuzzy filter similarly to `cmd-t`.

To search for symbols across your project, use `cmd-shift-r`. First you'll need to make sure you have `tags` (or `TAGS`) file generated for your project. This can be done by installing http://ctags.sourceforge.net[ctags] and running a command such as `ctags -R src/` from the command line in your project's root directory.

Using http://brew.sh/[Homebrew]? Just run
`brew install ctags`.

You can customize how tags are generated by creating your own `.ctags` file in your home directory (`~/.ctags`). An example can be found https://github.com/atom/symbols-view/blob/master/lib/.ctags[here].
