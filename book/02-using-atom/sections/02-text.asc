[[_moving_in_atom]]
=== Moving in Atom

`cntl-G` - go to line

basic emacs bindings

`cntl-[PBNF]` - simple movement

* move to beginning/end of word
* move to next word boundry
* move to top/bottom
* move to beginning/end of line
* move to first character of line
* move to next/prev word
* move to beginning of next/prev paragraph

==== Navigating by Symbols

To jump to a symbol such as a method definition, press `cmd-r`. This opens a list of all symbols in the current file, which you can fuzzy filter similarly to `cmd-t`.

To search for symbols across your project, use `cmd-shift-r`. First you'll need to make sure you have `tags` (or `TAGS`) file generated for your project. This can be done by installing http://ctags.sourceforge.net[ctags] and running a command such as `ctags -R src/` from the command line in your project's root directory.

Using http://brew.sh/[Homebrew]? Just run
`brew install ctags`.

You can customize how tags are generated by creating your own `.ctags` file in your home directory (`~/.ctags`). An example can be found https://github.com/atom/symbols-view/blob/master/lib/.ctags[here].
