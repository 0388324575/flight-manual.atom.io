=== Maintaining Your Packages

While publishing is, by far, the most common action you will perform when working with the packages you provide, there are other things you may need to do.

==== Unpublish a Version

If you mistakenly published a version of your package or perhaps you find a glaring bug or security hole, you may want to unpublish just that version of your package. For example, if your package is named `package-name` and the bad version of your package is v1.2.3 then the command you would execute is:

```bash
apm unpublish package-name@1.2.3
```

This will remove just this particular version from the https://atom.io package registry. Anyone who has already downloaded this version will still have it, but it will no longer be available for installation by others.

==== Adding a Collaborator

Some packages get too big for one person. Sometimes priorities change and someone else wants to help out. You can let others help or create co-owners by https://help.github.com/articles/adding-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository/[adding them as a collaborator] on the GitHub repository for your package. *Note:* Anyone that has push access to your repository will have the ability to publish new versions of the package that belongs to that repository.

You can also have packages that are owned by a https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-new-organization-account/[GitHub organization]. Anyone who is a member of an organization's https://help.github.com/articles/permission-levels-for-an-organization-repository/[team] which has push access to the package's repository will be able to publish new versions of the package.

==== Transferring Ownership

CAUTION: This is a permanent change. There is no going back!

If you want to hand off support of your package to someone else, you can do that by https://help.github.com/articles/transferring-a-repository/[transferring the package's repository] to the new owner.

==== Unpublish Your Package

WARNING: It is important that you unpublish your package _before_ deleting your repository. If you delete the repository first, you will lose access to the package and will not be able to recover it without assistance.

If you no longer want to support your package and cannot find anyone to take it over, you can unpublish your package from https://atom.io. For example, if your package is named `package-name` then the command you would execute is:

```bash
apm unpublish package-name
```

This will remove your package from the https://atom.io package registry. Anyone who has already downloaded a copy of your package will still have it and be able to use it, but it will no longer be available for installation by others.

==== Rename Your Package

You can rename your package by publishing a new version with the name changed in your package's `package.json`. Requests made to the previous name will be forwarded to the new name.

First, edit the `name` field in your package's `package.json`:
```json
{
  "name": "new-name-of-package"
}
```

Then commit your changes:
```bash
git commit -am "Rename package"
```

Then, publish a new version of your package:

```bash
apm publish minor
```
