=== Atom Basics

Now that Atom is installed on your system, let's fire it up, configure it and get acquainted with the editor.

When you launch Atom for the first time, you should get a screen that looks like this:

This is the Atom welcome screen and gives you a pretty good starting point for how to get started with the editor.

==== Command Palette

In that welcome screen, we are introduced to probably the most important command in Atom, the ``Command Palette''. If you hit `cmd-shift-P` while focused in an editor pane, the command palette will pop up. This search-driven menu can do just about any major task that is possible in Atom. Instead of clicking around all the application menus to look for something, you can just hit `cmd-shift-P` and search for the command.

Not only can you see and quickly search through thousands of possible commands, but you can also see if there is a keybinding associated with it. This is great because it means you can guess your way to doing interesting things while also learning the shortcut key strokes for doing it.
