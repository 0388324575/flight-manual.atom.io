=== Atom Basics

Now that Atom is installed on your system, let's fire it up, configure it and get acquainted with the editor.

When you launch Atom for the first time, you should get a screen that looks like this:

.Atom's welcome screen

This is the Atom welcome screen and gives you a pretty good starting point for how to get started with the editor.

==== Command Palette

In that welcome screen, we are introduced to probably the most important command in Atom, the ``Command Palette''. If you hit `cmd-shift-P` while focused in an editor pane, the command palette will pop up.

[NOTE]
====
Throughout the book we will use shortcut keybindings like `cmd-shift-P` to demonstrate how to run a command.
These are the default keybindings for Atom on Mac. They may occasionally be slightly different depending on your platform.

You can use the Command Palette to look up the correct keybindings if it doesn't work for some reason.
====

This search-driven menu can do just about any major task that is possible in Atom. Instead of clicking around all the application menus to look for something, you can just hit `cmd-shift-P` and search for the command.

Not only can you see and quickly search through thousands of possible commands, but you can also see if there is a keybinding associated with it. This is great because it means you can guess your way to doing interesting things while also learning the shortcut key strokes for doing it.

For the rest of the book, we will try to be clear as to the text you can search for in the Command Palette in addition to the keybinding for different commands.

==== Settings and Preferences

Atom has a number of settings and preferences you can modify on it's Settings screen.

This includes things like changing the color scheme or theme, specifying how to handle wrapping, font settings, tab size, scroll speed and much more. You can also use this screen to install new packages and themes, which we'll cover in <<_atom_packages>>.

To open the Settings screen, you can go to the 'Preferences' menu item under the main ``Atom'' menu in the menu bar. You can also search for `settings-view:open` in the command palette or use the `cmd-,` keybinding.

===== Changing the Color Theme

The Settings view also lets you change the color themes for Atom. Atom ships with 2 different UI color themes, one dark and one light, as well as 6 different syntax color themes. You can modify the active theme or install new themes by clicking on the ``Themes'' menu item in the sidebar of the Settings view.

The UI themes modify the color of UI elements like the tabs and the tree view, while the syntax themes modify the syntax highlighting of text you load into the editor. To change the theme, simply pick something different in the dropdowns.

There are also dozens of themes on Atom.io that you can choose from if you want something different. We will also cover customizing a theme in <<_customizing_themes>> and creating your own theme in <<_creating_themes>>.

===== Soft Wrap

You can also use the Settings view to specify your whitespace and wrapping preferences.

.Changing the theme from Settings

Enabling ``Soft Tabs'' will insert spaces instead of actual tab characters when you hit the `tab` key and the ``Tab Length'' specifies how many spaces to insert when you do so, or how many spaces to represent a tab as if ``Soft Tabs'' is disabled.

The ``Soft Wrap'' option will wrap lines that are too long to fit in your current window. If soft wrapping is disabled, the lines will simply run off the side of the screen and you will have to scroll the window to see the rest of the content. If ``Soft Wrap At Preferred Line Length'' is toggled, the lines will wrap at 80 characters instead of the end of the screen. You can also change the default line length to something other than 80 on this sames screen.

In <<_basic_customization>> we will see how to set different wrap preferences for different types of files (for example, if you want to wrap Markdown files but not code files).

===== Beta Features

As Atom is developed, there are occasionally new features that are tested before they are mainlined for everyone. In some cases, those changes are shipped turned off by default but can be enabled in the Settings view should you wish to try them out.

.Beta features in the Settings view

This is mainly useful for Package developers to get access to a feature or change before it ships to the general population to ensure their package still works with the new functionality.  However, it may be interesting to try some of these features out occasionally if you're interested in what's coming soon.
