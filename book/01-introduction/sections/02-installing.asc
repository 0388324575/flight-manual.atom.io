=== Installing Atom

To get started with Atom, we'll need to get it on our system. This section will go over installing Atom on Mac, Windows and Linux, as well as the basics of how to build it from source.

Installing Atom should be fairly simple on any of these systems. Generally you can simply go to http://atom.io and at the top of the page you should see a download button as in <<_download_button>>.

The buttons should be specific to your platform and easily installable. However, let's go over them here in a bit of detail.

==== Atom on Mac

Atom was originally built for Mac and should be a simple setup process. You can either hit the download button from the atom.io site or you can go to the Atom releases page at:

https://github.com/atom/atom/releases/latest

Here you can download the `atom-mac.zip` file explicitly.

Once you have that file, you can click on it to extract the binary and then drag the new `Atom` application into your ``Applications'' folder.


==== Atom on Windows

The best way to install Atom on Windows is by installing `chocolatey`, which you can get from https://chocolatey.org, and then running:

  cinst Atom

This will install Atom, add the `atom` and `apm` commands to your `PATH`, create shortcuts on the desktop and in the start menu, and also add an Open with Atom context menu in the Explorer.

You can then update to the latest Atom release in the future by simply running:

  cup Atom

If you haven't used `chocolatey` before, this is the perfect chance to start. It is similar to Homebrew on Mac OS X or apt-get on Ubuntu. It allows you to easily discover, install, and update applications from the command line and there are already over 1,900 packages in the registry.

If you have any problems installing Atom using `chocolatey`, you can open up an issue on the `atom/chocolatey` repository.

If you just want to download a `.zip` of the latest Atom release for Windows, you can get it from the https://github.com/atom/atom/releases[Atom releases page] at https://github.com/atom/atom/releases.

[NOTE]
====
Atom on Windows does not currently auto-update so you will need to download new versions manually. Going forward we plan on adding an auto-updater that works the same as the Mac version.

==== Atom on Linux

To install Atom on Linux, you can download a https://atom.io/download/deb[Debian package] or https://atom.io/download/rpm[RPM package] either from the http://atom.io[main Atom website] at atom.io or from the Atom project releases page at https://github.com/atom/atom/releases.

On Debian, you would install the Debian package with `dpkg -i`:

  $ sudo dpkg -i atom-amd64.deb

On RedHat or another RPM based system, you would use the `rpm -i` command:

  $ rpm -i atom.x86_64.rpm


==== Atom from Source

If none of those options works for you or you just want to build Atom from source, you can also do that.

There are detailed and up to date build instructions for Mac, Windows, Linux and FreeBSD at: https://github.com/atom/atom/tree/master/docs/build-instructions

In general, you need Git, a C++ toolchain, and Node to build it. See the repository documentation for detailed instructions.
