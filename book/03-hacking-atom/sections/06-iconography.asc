=== Iconography

Every so often you come to a point in time, where, to represent something, an icon is better off than words are.
Since Atom is made by GitHub, their https://octicons.github.com/[Octicons] font is available for use.

===== Usage

Atom's usage of https://octicons.github.com/[Octicons] differs just a bit from the standard usage of them, that you'd find, say, in a web project.

The biggest difference is in the naming of the icon classes. In regular webdev, you'd create something like this:

```html
  <span class = "octicon octicon-device-desktop"></span>
```
to make a monitor icon appear. In Atom, however, the icon classes are formed like this:

```css
  icon-something
```

And so, to get the same icon to appear as a span, you could do this:

```coffeescript
  @span class: 'icon-device-desktop'
```

The result is the same: the  https://octicons.github.com/icon/device-desktop/[device-desktop] icon appears.
