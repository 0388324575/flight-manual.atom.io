### Panes

You can split any editor pane horizontally or vertically by using `cmd-k arrow` where the arrow is the direction to split the pane. Once you have a split pane, you can move focus between them with `cmd-k cmd-arrow` where the arrow is the direction the focus should move to.

Each pane has its own "items" or files, which are represented by tabs. You can move the files from pane to pane by dragging them with the mouse and dropping them in the pane you want that file to be in.

To close a pane, close all its editors with `cmd-w`, then press `cmd-w` one more time to close the pane. You can configure panes to auto-close when empty in the Settings view.
