### Autocomplete

If you're still looking to save some typing time, Atom also ships with simple autocompletion functionality.

The autocompleter lets you view and insert possible completions in the editor using `ctrl-space`.

By default, the autocompleter will look through the current open file for strings that match what you're starting to type.

If you want more options, in the Settings panel for the autocomplete-plus package you can toggle a setting to make the autocompleter look for strings in all your open buffers rather than just the current file.

The Autocomplete functionality is implemented in the [atom/autocomplete-plus](https://github.com/atom/autocomplete-plus) package.
