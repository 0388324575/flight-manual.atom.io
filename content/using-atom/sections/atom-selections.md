### Atom Selections

Text selections in Atom support a number of actions, such as scoping deletion, indentation and search actions, and marking text for actions such as quoting and bracketing.

Selections mirror many of the movement commands. They're actually exactly the same keybindings as the movement commands, but with a `shift` key added in.

`ctrl-shift-P`:: Select up
`ctrl-shift-N`:: Select down
`ctrl-shift-B`:: Select previous character
`ctrl-shift-F`:: Select next character
`alt-shift-B`, `alt-shift-left`:: Select to beginning of word
`alt-shift-F`, `alt-shift-right`:: Select to end of word
`ctrl-shift-E`, `cmd-shift-right`:: Select to end of line
`ctrl-shift-A`, `cmd-shift-left`:: Select to first character of line
`cmd-shift-up`:: Select to top of file
`cmd-shift-down`:: Select to bottom of file

In addition to the cursor movement selection commands, there are also a few commands that help with selecting specific areas of content.

`cmd-A`:: Select the entire buffer
`cmd-L`:: Select entire line
`ctrl-shift-W`:: Select current word
