          "body": " Maintaining Your Packages While publishing is, by far, the most common action you will perform when working with the packages you provide, there are other things you may need to do.  Unpublish a Version If you mistakenly published a version of your package or perhaps you find a glaring bug or security hole, you may want to unpublish just that version of your package. For example, if your package is named package-name and the bad version of your package is v1.2.3 then the command you would execute is:  apm unpublish package-name@1.2.3  This will remove just this particular version from the https://atom.io package registry. Anyone who has already downloaded this version will still have it, but it will no longer be available for installation by others.  Adding a Collaborator Some packages get too big for one person. Sometimes priorities change and someone else wants to help out. You can let others help or create co-owners by adding them as a collaborator on the GitHub repository for your package. Note: Anyone that has push access to your repository will have the ability to publish new versions of the package that belongs to that repository. You can also have packages that are owned by a GitHub organization. Anyone who is a member of an organization's team which has push access to the package's repository will be able to publish new versions of the package.  Transferring Ownership  Danger:  This is a permanent change. There is no going back!   If you want to hand off support of your package to someone else, you can do that by transferring the package's repository to the new owner. Once you do that, they can publish a new version with the updated repository information in the package.json.  Unpublish Your Package  Warning: It is important that you unpublish your package before deleting your repository. If you delete the repository first, you will lose access to the package and will not be able to recover it without assistance.  If you no longer want to support your package and cannot find anyone to take it over, you can unpublish your package from https://atom.io. For example, if your package is named package-name then the command you would execute is:  apm unpublish package-name  This will remove your package from the https://atom.io package registry. Anyone who has already downloaded a copy of your package will still have it and be able to use it, but it will no longer be available for installation by others.  Rename Your Package If you need to rename your package for any reason, you can do so with one simple command – apm publish --rename changes the name field in your package's package.json, pushes a new commit and tag, and publishes your renamed package. Requests made to the previous name will be forwarded to the new name.  apm publish --rename new-package-name   Tip: Once a package name has been used, it cannot be re-used by another package even if the original package is unpublished.

          "body": " Scoped Settings, Scopes and Scope Descriptors Atom supports language-specific settings. You can soft wrap only Markdown files, or set the tab length to 4 in Python files. Language-specific settings are a subset of something more general we call \"scoped settings\". Scoped settings allow targeting down to a specific syntax token type. For example, you could conceivably set a setting to target only Ruby comments, only code inside Markdown files, or even only JavaScript function names.  Scope Names in Syntax Tokens Each token in the editor has a collection of scope names. For example, the aforementioned JavaScript function name might have the scope names function and name. An open paren might have the scope names punctuation, parameters, begin. Scope names work just like CSS classes. In fact, in the editor, scope names are attached to a token's DOM node as CSS classes. Take this piece of JavaScript: function functionName() { console.log('Log it out'); }  In the dev tools, the first line's markup looks like this.  All the class names on the spans are scope names. Any scope name can be used to target a setting's value.  Scope Selectors Scope selectors allow you to target specific tokens just like a CSS selector targets specific nodes in the DOM. Some examples: '.source.js' # selects all javascript tokens '.source.js .function.name' # selects all javascript function names '.function.name' # selects all function names in any language  Config::set accepts a scopeSelector. If you'd like to set a setting for JavaScript function names, you can give it the JavaScript function name scopeSelector: atom.config.set('my-package.my-setting', 'special value', scopeSelector: '.source.js .function.name')   Scope Descriptors A scope descriptor is an Object that wraps an Array of Strings. The Array describes a path from the root of the syntax tree to a token including all scope names for the entire path. In our JavaScript example above, a scope descriptor for the function name token would be: ['source.js', 'meta.function.js', 'entity.name.function.js']  Config::get accepts a scopeDescriptor. You can get the value for your setting scoped to JavaScript function names via: scopeDescriptor = ['source.js', 'meta.function.js', 'entity.name.function.js'] value = atom.config.get('my-package.my-setting', scope: scopeDescriptor)  But, you do not need to generate scope descriptors by hand. There are a couple methods available to get the scope descriptor from the editor:   Editor::getRootScopeDescriptor to get the language's descriptor. For example: [\".source.js\"]   Editor::scopeDescriptorForBufferPosition to get the descriptor at a specific position in the buffer.  Cursor::getScopeDescriptor to get a cursor's descriptor based on position. eg. if the cursor were in the name of the method in our example it would return [\"source.js\", \"meta.function.js\", \"entity.name.function.js\"]   Let's revisit our example using these methods: editor = atom.workspace.getActiveTextEditor() cursor = editor.getLastCursor() valueAtCursor = atom.config.get('my-package.my-setting', scope: cursor.getScopeDescriptor()) valueForLanguage = atom.config.get('my-package.my-setting', scope: editor.getRootScopeDescriptor()) ",

          "body": " Serialization in Atom When a window is refreshed or restored from a previous session, the view and its associated objects are deserialized from a JSON representation that was stored during the window's previous shutdown. For your own views and objects to be compatible with refreshing, you'll need to make them play nicely with the serializing and deserializing.  Package Serialization Hook Your package's main module can optionally include a serialize method, which will be called before your package is deactivated. You should return a JSON-serializable object, which will be handed back to you as an object argument to activate next time it is called. In the following example, the package keeps an instance of MyObject in the same state across refreshes. module.exports = activate: (state) -&gt; @myObject = if state atom.deserializers.deserialize(state) else new MyObject(\"Hello\") serialize: -&gt; @myObject.serialize()   Serialization Methods class MyObject atom.deserializers.add(this) @deserialize: ({data}) -&gt; new MyObject(data) constructor: (@data) -&gt; serialize: -&gt; { deserializer: 'MyObject', data: @data }   serialize()  Objects that you want to serialize should implement .serialize(). This method should return a serializable object, and it must contain a key named deserializer whose value is the name of a registered deserializer that can convert the rest of the data to an object. It's usually just the name of the class itself.  deserialize(data)  The other side of the coin is the deserialize method, which is usually a class-level method on the same class that implements serialize. This method's job is to convert a state object returned from a previous call serialize back into a genuine object.  atom.deserializers.add(klass) You need to call the atom.deserializers.add method with your class in order to make it available to the deserialization system. Now you can call the global deserialize method with state returned from serialize, and your class's deserialize method will be selected automatically.  Versioning class MyObject atom.deserializers.add(this) @version: 2 @deserialize: (state) -&gt; ... serialize: -&gt; { version: @constructor.version, ... }  Your serializable class can optionally have a class-level @version property and include a version key in its serialized state. When deserializing, Atom will only attempt to call deserialize if the two versions match, and otherwise return undefined. We plan on implementing a migration system in the future, but this at least protects you from improperly deserializing old state.",

          "category_url": "",
          "url": "/behind-atom/sections/keymaps-in-depth/",
          "body": " Keymaps In-Depth  Structure of a Keymap File Keymap files are encoded as JSON or CSON files containing nested hashes. They work much like style sheets, but instead of applying style properties to elements matching the selector, they specify the meaning of keystrokes on elements matching the selector. Here is an example of some bindings that apply when keystrokes pass through atom-text-editor elements:  'atom-text-editor': 'cmd-delete': 'editor:delete-to-beginning-of-line' 'alt-backspace': 'editor:delete-to-beginning-of-word' 'ctrl-A': 'editor:select-to-first-character-of-line' 'ctrl-shift-e': 'editor:select-to-end-of-line' 'cmd-left': 'editor:move-to-first-character-of-line' 'atom-text-editor:not([mini])': 'cmd-alt-[': 'editor:fold-current-row' 'cmd-alt-]': 'editor:unfold-current-row'    'atom-text-editor': 'ctrl-left': 'editor:move-to-beginning-of-word' 'ctrl-right': 'editor:move-to-end-of-word' 'ctrl-shift-left': 'editor:select-to-beginning-of-word' 'ctrl-shift-right': 'editor:select-to-end-of-word' 'ctrl-backspace': 'editor:delete-to-beginning-of-word' 'ctrl-delete': 'editor:delete-to-end-of-word' 'atom-text-editor:not([mini])': 'ctrl-alt-[': 'editor:fold-current-row' 'ctrl-alt-]': 'editor:unfold-current-row'    'atom-text-editor': 'ctrl-left': 'editor:move-to-beginning-of-word' 'ctrl-right': 'editor:move-to-end-of-word' 'ctrl-shift-left': 'editor:select-to-beginning-of-word' 'ctrl-shift-right': 'editor:select-to-end-of-word' 'ctrl-backspace': 'editor:delete-to-beginning-of-word' 'ctrl-delete': 'editor:delete-to-end-of-word' 'atom-text-editor:not([mini])': 'ctrl-alt-[': 'editor:fold-current-row' 'ctrl-alt-]': 'editor:unfold-current-row'   Beneath the first selector are several keybindings, mapping specific key combinations to commands. When an element with the atom-text-editor class is focused and Alt+BackspaceCtrl+Backspace is pressed, a custom DOM event called editor:delete-to-beginning-of-word is emitted on the atom-text-editor element. The second selector group also targets editors, but only if they don't have the mini attribute. In this example, the commands for code folding don't really make sense on mini-editors, so the selector restricts them to regular editors.  Key Combinations Key combinations express one or more keys combined with optional modifier keys. For example: ctrl-w v, or cmd-shift-up. A key combination is composed of the following symbols, separated by a -. A key sequence can be expressed as key combinations separated by spaces.    Type Examples     Character literals  a 4 $    Modifier keys  cmd ctrl alt shift    Special keys  enter escape backspace delete tab home end pageup pagedown left right up down      Commands Commands are custom DOM events that are triggered when a key combination or sequence matches a binding. This allows user interface code to listen for named commands without specifying the specific keybinding that triggers it. For example, the following code creates a command to insert the current date in an editor: atom.commands.add 'atom-text-editor', 'user:insert-date': (event) -&gt; editor = @getModel() editor.insertText(new Date().toLocaleString())  atom.commands refers to the global CommandRegistry instance where all commands are set and consequently picked up by the command palette. When you are looking to bind new keys, it is often useful to use the Command Palette (Cmd+Shift+PCtrl+Shift+P) to discover what commands are being listened for in a given focus context. Commands are \"humanized\" following a simple algorithm, so a command like editor:fold-current-row would appear as \"Editor: Fold Current Row\".  \"Composed\" Commands A common question is, \"How do I make a single keybinding execute two or more commands?\" There isn't any direct support for this in Atom, but it can be achieved by creating a custom command that performs the multiple actions you desire and then creating a keybinding for that command. For example, let's say I want to create a \"composed\" command that performs a Select Line followed by Cut. You could add the following to your init.coffee: atom.commands.add 'atom-text-editor', 'custom:cut-line', -&gt; editor = atom.workspace.getActiveTextEditor() editor.selectLinesContainingCursors() editor.cutSelectedText()  Then let's say we want to map this custom command to alt-ctrl-z, you could add the following to your keymap: 'atom-text-editor': 'alt-ctrl-z': 'custom:cut-line'   Specificity and Cascade Order As is the case with CSS applying styles, when multiple bindings match for a single element, the conflict is resolved by choosing the most specific selector. If two matching selectors have the same specificity, the binding for the selector appearing later in the cascade takes precedence. Currently, there's no way to specify selector ordering within a single keymap, because JSON objects do not preserve order. We handle cases where selector ordering is critical by breaking the keymap into separate files, such as snippets-1.cson and snippets-2.cson.  Selectors and Custom Packages If a keybinding should only apply to a specific grammar, you can limit bindings to that grammar using the data-grammar attribute on the atom-text-editor element: \"atom-text-editor[data-grammar='source example']\": 'ctrl-.': 'custom:custom-command'  While selectors can be applied to the entire editor by what grammar is associated with it, they cannot be applied to scopes defined within the grammar or to sub-elements of atom-text-editor.  Removing Bindings When the keymap system encounters a binding with the unset! directive as its command, it will treat the current element as if it had no key bindings matching the current keystroke sequence and continue searching from its parent. For example, the following code removes the keybinding for a in the Tree View, which is normally used to trigger the tree-view:add-file command: '.tree-view': 'a': 'unset!'   But if some element above the Tree View had a keybinding for a, that keybinding would still execute even when the focus is inside the Tree View. When the keymap system encounters a binding with the abort! directive as its command, it will stop searching for a keybinding. For example, the following code removes the keybinding for Cmd+OCtrl+O when the selection is inside an editor pane:  'atom-text-editor': 'cmd-o': 'abort!'    'atom-text-editor': 'ctrl-o': 'abort!'    'atom-text-editor': 'ctrl-o': 'abort!'   But if you click inside the Tree View and press Cmd+OCtrl+O, it will work.  Forcing Chromium's Native Keystroke Handling If you want to force the native browser behavior for a given keystroke, use the native! directive as the command of a binding. This can be useful to enable the correct behavior in native input elements, for example. If you apply the .native-key-bindings class to an element, all the keystrokes typically handled by the browser will be assigned the native! directive.  Overloading Key Bindings Occasionally, it makes sense to layer multiple actions on top of the same key binding. An example of this is the snippets package. Snippets are inserted by typing a snippet prefix such as for and then pressing Tab. Every time Tab is pressed, we want to execute code attempting to expand a snippet if one exists for the text preceding the cursor. If a snippet doesn't exist, we want Tab to actually insert whitespace. To achieve this, the snippets package makes use of the .abortKeyBinding() method on the event object representing the snippets:expand command. # pseudo-code editor.command 'snippets:expand', (e) =&gt; if @cursorFollowsValidPrefix() @expandSnippet() else e.abortKeyBinding()  When the event handler observes that the cursor does not follow a valid prefix, it calls e.abortKeyBinding(), telling the keymap system to continue searching for another matching binding.  Step-by-Step: How Keydown Events are Mapped to Commands  A keydown event occurs on a focused element. Starting at the focused element, the keymap walks upward towards the root of the document, searching for the most specific CSS selector that matches the current DOM element and also contains a keystroke pattern matching the keydown event. When a matching keystroke pattern is found, the search is terminated and the pattern's corresponding command is triggered on the current element. If .abortKeyBinding() is called on the triggered event object, the search is resumed, triggering a binding on the next-most-specific CSS selector for the same element or continuing upward to parent elements. If no bindings are found, the event is handled by Chromium normally. ",

These methods will be called any time a package is activated that consumes their corresponding service. They should return a value that implements the service's API. module.exports = activate: -&gt; # ...  provideMyServiceV1: -&gt; adaptToLegacyAPI(myService) provideMyServiceV2: -&gt; myService  Similarly, to consume a service, specify one or more version ranges, each paired with the name of a method on the package's main module: { \"consumedServices\": { \"another-service\": { \"versions\": { \"^1.2.3\": \"consumeAnotherServiceV1\", \"&gt;=2.3.4 &lt;2.5\": \"consumeAnotherServiceV2\" } } } }  These methods will be called any time a package is activated that provides their corresponding service.

          "body": " Why Atom? There are a lot of text editors out there; why should you spend your time learning about and using Atom? Editors like Sublime and TextMate offer convenience but only limited extensibility. On the other end of the spectrum, Emacs and Vim offer extreme flexibility, but they aren't very approachable and can only be customized with special-purpose scripting languages. We think we can do better. Our goal is a zero-compromise combination of hackability and usability: an editor that will be welcoming to an elementary school student on their first day learning to code, but also a tool they won't outgrow as they develop into seasoned hackers. As we've used Atom to build Atom, what began as an experiment has gradually matured into a tool we can't live without. On the surface, Atom is the modern desktop text editor you've come to expect. Pop the hood, however, and you'll discover a system begging to be hacked on.  The Nucleus of Atom The web is not without its faults, but two decades of development has forged it into an incredibly malleable and powerful platform. So when we set out to write a text editor that we ourselves would want to extend, web technology was the obvious choice. But first, we had to free it from its chains.  The Native Web Web browsers are great for browsing web pages, but writing code is a specialized activity that warrants dedicated tools. More importantly, the browser severely restricts access to the local system for security reasons, and for us, a text editor that couldn't write files or run local subprocesses was a non-starter. For this reason, we didn't build Atom as a traditional web application. Instead, Atom is a specialized variant of Chromium designed to be a text editor rather than a web browser. Every Atom window is essentially a locally-rendered web page. All the APIs available to a typical Node.js application are also available to the code running in each window's JavaScript context. This hybrid provides a really unique client-side development experience. Since everything is local, you don't have to worry about asset pipelines, script concatenation, and asynchronous module definitions. If you want to load some code, just require it at the top of your file. Node's module system makes it easy to break the system down into lots of small, focused packages.  JavaScript, Meet C++ Interacting with native code is also really simple. For example, we wrote a wrapper around the Oniguruma regular expression engine for our TextMate grammar support. In a browser, that would have required adventures with NaCl or Esprima. Node integration made it easy. In addition to the Node APIs, we also expose APIs for native dialogs, adding application and context menu items, manipulating the window dimensions, etc.  Web Tech: The Fun Parts Another great thing about writing code for Atom is the guarantee that it's running on the newest version of Chromium. That means we can ignore issues like browser compatibility and polyfills. We can use all the web's shiny features of tomorrow, today. For example, the layout of our workspace and panes is based on flexbox. It's an emerging standard and has gone through a lot of change since we started using it, but none of that mattered as long as it worked. With the entire industry pushing web technology forward, we're confident that we're building Atom on fertile ground. Native UI technologies come and go, but the web is a standard that becomes more capable and ubiquitous with every passing year. We're excited to dig deeper into its toolbox.  An Open Source Text Editor We see Atom as a perfect complement to GitHub's primary mission of building better software by working together. Atom is a long-term investment, and GitHub will continue to support its development with a dedicated team going forward. But we also know that we can't achieve our vision for Atom alone. As Emacs and Vim have demonstrated over the past three decades, if you want to build a thriving, long-lasting community around a text editor, it has to be open source. The entire Atom editor is free and open source and is available under the https://github.com/atom organization.",

          "body": " Installing Atom To get started with Atom, we'll need to get it on your system. This section will go over installing Atom on your system as well as the basics of how to build it from source. Installing Atom should be fairly simple. Generally, you can go to https://atom.io and at the top of the page you should see a download button as shown here:          The button or buttons should be specific to your platform and the download package should be easily installable. However, let's go over them here in a bit of detail.   Installing Atom on Mac Atom follows the standard Mac zip installation process. You can either press the download button from the https://atom.io site or you can go to the Atom releases page to download the atom-mac.zip file explicitly. Once you have that file, you can click on it to extract the application and then drag the new Atom application into your \"Applications\" folder. When you first open Atom, it will try to install the atom and apm commands for use in the terminal. In some cases, Atom might not be able to install these commands because it needs an administrator password. To check if Atom was able to install the atom command, for example, open a terminal window and type which atom. If the atom command has been installed, you'll see something like this:  which atom /usr/local/bin/atom $  If the atom command wasn't installed, the which command won't return anything:  which atom $  To install the atom and apm commands, run \"Window: Install Shell Commands\" from the Command Palette, which will prompt you for an administrator password.    Installing Atom on Windows Atom is available with a Windows installer that can be downloaded from https://atom.io or from Atom Releases named AtomSetup.exe. This setup program will install Atom, add the atom and apm commands to your PATH, create shortcuts on the desktop and in the start menu, add an \"Open with Atom\" context menu in the Explorer and make Atom available for association with files using \"Open with...\".   Portable mode for Windows Atom can also be run in portable mode on Windows allowing it to be placed on a removable storage device where it will also store its settings, packages, cache, etc. so you can easily take it from machine to machine without needing to install anything. To get started with Atom in portable mode:  Download atom-windows.zip from Atom Releases  Extract atom-windows.zip to your removable storage device Launch atom.exe from the extracted Atom folder Once Atom has launched it will create an .atom folder in %USERPROFILE%  Move that .atom folder to be alongside your Atom folder on your removable storage device  Now whenever you launch atom.exe from your removable storage device it will operate in portable mode and store all its settings and packages in the .atom folder on the device. Note that there are some limitations to portable mode:  No Explorer integration or command-line PATH setup The .atom folder must be alongside the folder containing atom.exe (not inside it) The .atom folder must be writeable The ATOM_HOME environment variable must not be set (this overrides portable behavior)   MSI Installer for Windows Atom is also available in an .MSI package from Atom Releases which can be deployed or installed on a machine. Any user signing in to that machine will find Atom installed for them automatically. (It may take a few seconds the first time they sign in for the icon to appear on the desktop). Should the user uninstall Atom it will only affect themselves and it will not automatically reinstall when they next sign in. If eventually that individual wants to reinstall Atom again, they can delete the %LOCALAPPDATA%\\Atom folder.    Installing Atom on Linux To install Atom on Linux, you can download a Debian package or RPM package either from the main Atom website or from the Atom project releases page. These packages do not currently have auto-update features, so when you would like to upgrade to a new release of Atom, you will have to repeat this installation process.  Debian and Related To install Atom on Debian, Ubuntu, or related systems:  # Install Atom sudo dpkg -i atom-amd64.deb # Install Atom's dependencies if they are missing sudo apt-get -f install   RedHat Enterprise and Related To install Atom on CentOS, Oracle Linux, RedHat Enterprise Linux, Scientific Linux or related systems that use the yum package manager:  sudo yum install -y atom.x86_64.rpm   Fedora and Related To download and install the latest release of Atom on Fedora or other systems that use the DNF package manager:  sudo dnf install -y atom.x86_64.rpm   SUSE and Related To download and install the latest release of Atom on openSUSE or other systems that use the Zypp package manager:  sudo zypper in -y atom.x86_64.rpm    Building Atom from Source If you just want to build Atom from source, you can also do that. The Atom GitHub repository has detailed build instructions for Mac, Windows, Linux and FreeBSD.  Proxy and Firewall Settings  Behind a firewall? If you are behind a firewall and seeing SSL errors when installing packages you can disable strict SSL by running:  apm config set strict-ssl false   Using a proxy? If you are using a HTTP(S) proxy you can configure apm to use it by running:  apm config set https-proxy YOUR_PROXY_ADDRESS  You can run apm config get https-proxy to verify it has been set correctly.",

          "body": " Atom Basics Now that Atom is installed on your system, let's fire it up, configure it and get acquainted with the editor. When you launch Atom for the first time, you should get a screen that looks like this:  This is the Atom welcome screen and gives you a pretty good starting point for how to get started with the editor.  Terminology You can find definitions for all of the various terms that we use throughout the manual in our Glossary.  Command Palette In that welcome screen, we are introduced to probably the most important command in Atom, the Command Palette. If you press Cmd+Shift+PCtrl+Shift+P while focused in an editor pane, the command palette will pop up.  Throughout the book we will use shortcut keybindings like Cmd+Shift+PCtrl+Shift+P to demonstrate how to run a command. These are the default keybindings for the platform that we detected you running. If you want to see a different platform than the one we detected, you may choose a different one by using the platform selector near the top of the page:  If the Platform Selector is not present, then the current page doesn't have any platform-specific content. If you have customized your Atom keymap, you can always see the keybinding you have mapped in the Command Palette or the Keybindings tab in the Settings View.  This search-driven menu can do just about any major task that is possible in Atom. Instead of clicking around all the application menus to look for something, you can press Cmd+Shift+PCtrl+Shift+P and search for the command.  Not only can you see and quickly search through thousands of possible commands, but you can also see if there is a keybinding associated with it. This is great because it means you can guess your way to doing interesting things while also learning the shortcut key strokes for doing it. For the rest of the book, we will try to be clear as to the text you can search for in the Command Palette in addition to the keybinding for different commands.  Settings and Preferences Atom has a number of settings and preferences you can modify in the Settings View.  This includes things like changing the theme, specifying how to handle wrapping, font settings, tab size, scroll speed and much more. You can also use this screen to install new packages and themes, which we'll cover in Atom Packages. To open the Settings View, you can:  Use the Atom &gt; PreferencesFile &gt; SettingsEdit &gt; Preferences menu item in the menu bar Search for settings-view:open in the Command Palette  Use the Cmd+,Ctrl+, keybinding   Changing the Theme The Settings View also lets you change the themes for Atom. Atom ships with 4 different UI themes, dark and light variants of the Atom and One theme, as well as 8 different syntax themes. You can modify the active theme or install new themes by clicking on the Themes tab in the sidebar of the Settings View.  The UI themes control the style of UI elements like the tabs and the tree view, while the syntax themes control the syntax highlighting of text you load into the editor. To change the syntax or UI theme, simply pick something different in the appropriate dropdown list. There are also dozens of themes on https://atom.io that you can choose from if you want something different. We will cover customizing a theme in Style Tweaks and creating your own theme in Creating a Theme.  Soft Wrap You can use the Settings View to specify your whitespace and wrapping preferences.  Enabling \"Soft Tabs\" will insert spaces instead of actual tab characters when you press the Tab key and the \"Tab Length\" setting specifies how many spaces to insert when you do so, or how many spaces are used to represent a tab if \"Soft Tabs\" is disabled. The \"Soft Wrap\" option will wrap lines that are too long to fit in your current window. If soft wrapping is disabled, the lines will simply run off the side of the screen and you will have to scroll the window to see the rest of the content. If \"Soft Wrap At Preferred Line Length\" is toggled, the lines will wrap at 80 characters instead of the end of the screen. You can also change the default line length to a value other than 80 on this screen. In Basic Customization we will see how to set different wrap preferences for different types of files (for example, if you want to wrap Markdown files but not other files).  Opening, Modifying and Saving Files Now that your editor is looking and acting how you want, let's start opening up and editing files. This is a text editor after all, right?  Opening a File There are several ways to open a file in Atom. You can do it by choosing File &gt; Open from the menu bar or by pressing Cmd+OCtrl+O to choose a file from the standard dialog.  This is useful for opening a file that is not contained in the project you're currently in (more on that next), or if you're starting from a new window for some reason. Another way to open a file in Atom is from the command line using the atom command. The Atom menu bar has a command named \"Install Shell Commands\" which installs the atom and apm commands if Atom wasn't able to install them itself.The atom and apm commands are installed automatically as a part of Atom's installation process. You can run the atom command with one or more file paths to open up those files in Atom.  atom --help Atom Editor v1.8.0 Usage: atom [options] [path ...] One or more paths to files or folders may be specified. If there is an existing Atom window that contains all of the given folders, the paths will be opened in that window. Otherwise, they will be opened in a new window. ...  This is a great tool if you're used to the terminal or you work from the terminal a lot. Just fire off atom [files] and you're ready to start editing.  Editing and Saving a File Editing a file is pretty straightforward. You can click around and scroll with your mouse and type to change the content. There is no special editing mode or key commands. If you prefer editors with modes or more complex key commands, you should take a look at the Atom package list. There are a lot of packages that emulate popular styles. To save a file you can choose File &gt; Save from the menu bar or Cmd+SCtrl+S to save the file. If you choose File &gt; Save As or press Cmd+Shift+SCtrl+Shift+S then you can save the current content in your editor under a different file name. Finally, you can choose File &gt; Save All or press Alt+Cmd+S to save all the open files in Atom.  Opening Directories Atom doesn't just work with single files though; you will most likely spend most of your time working on projects with multiple files. To open a directory, choose the menu item File &gt; OpenFile &gt; Open Folder and select a directory from the dialog. You can also add more than one directory to your current Atom window, by choosing File &gt; Add Project Folder from the menu bar or pressing Cmd+Shift+OAlt+Ctrl+O. You can open any number of directories from the command line by passing their paths to the atom command line tool. For example, you could run the command atom ./hopes ./dreams to open both the hopes and the dreams directories at the same time. When you open Atom with one or more directories, you will automatically get a Tree View on the side of your window.  The Tree View allows you to explore and modify the file and directory structure of your project. You can open, rename, delete and create new files from this view. You can also hide and show it with Cmd+\\Ctrl+\\ or the tree-view:toggle command from the Command Palette, and Ctrl+0Alt+\\ will focus it. When the Tree view has focus you can press A, M, or Delete to add, move or delete files and folders. You can also right-click on a file or folder in the Tree view to see many of the various options, including all of these plus showing the file in FinderWindows Exploreryour native filesystem or copying the file path to the clipboard.  Atom Packages Like many parts of Atom, the Tree View is not built directly into the editor, but is its own standalone package that is shipped with Atom by default. Packages that are bundled with Atom are referred to as Core packages. Ones that aren't bundled with Atom are referred to as Community packages. You can find the source code to the Tree View on GitHub at https://github.com/atom/tree-view. This is one of the interesting things about Atom. Many of its core features are actually just packages implemented the same way you would implement any other functionality. This means that if you don't like the Tree View for example, you could write your own implementation of that functionality and replace it entirely.   Opening a File in a Project Once you have a project open in Atom, you can easily find and open any file within that project. If you press Cmd+TCtrl+T or Cmd+PCtrl+P, the Fuzzy Finder will pop up. This will let you quickly search for any file in any directory your project by typing parts of the path.  You can also search through only the files currently opened (rather than every file in your project) with Cmd+BCtrl+B. This searches through your \"buffers\" or open files. You can also limit this fuzzy search with Cmd+Shift+BCtrl+Shift+B, which searches only through the files which are new or have been modified since your last Git commit. The fuzzy finder uses the core.ignoredNames, fuzzy-finder.ignoredNames and core.excludeVCSIgnoredPaths configuration settings to filter out files and folders that will not be shown. If you have a project with tons of files you don't want it to search through, you can add patterns or paths to either of these config settings or your standard .gitignore files. We'll learn more about config settings in Global Configuration Settings, but for now you can easily set these in the Settings View under Core Settings. Both core.ignoredNames and fuzzy-finder.ignoredNames are interpreted as glob patterns as implemented by the minimatch Node module.  Configuration Setting Notation Sometimes you'll see us refer to configuration settings all spelled out like \"Ignored Names in Core Settings\". Other times you'll see us use the shorthand name like core.ignoredNames. Both of these refer to the same thing. The shorthand is the package name, then a dot ., followed by the \"camel-cased\" name of the setting. If you have a phrase you want to camel-case, follow these steps:  Lowercase the first word Capitalize the first letter in all other words Remove the spaces  So \"Ignored Names\" becomes \"ignoredNames\".

          "body": " Package: Modifying Text Now that we have our first package written, let's go through examples of other types of packages we can make. This section will guide you though creating a simple command that replaces the selected text with ascii art. When you run our new command with the word \"cool\" selected, it will be replaced with:  o888 ooooooo ooooooo ooooooo 888 888 888 888 888 888 888 888 888 888 888 888 888 888 88ooo888 88ooo88 88ooo88 o888o  This should demonstrate how to do basic text manipulation in the current text buffer and how to deal with selections. The final package can be viewed at https://github.com/atom/ascii-art.  Basic Text Insertion To begin, press Cmd+Shift+PCtrl+Shift+P to bring up the Command Palette. Type \"generate package\" and select the \"Package Generator: Generate Package\" command, just as we did in the section on package generation. Enter ascii-art as the name of the package. Now let's edit the package files to make our ASCII Art package do something interesting. Since this package doesn't need any UI, we can remove all view-related code so go ahead and delete lib/ascii-art-view.coffee, spec/ascii-art-view-spec.coffee, and styles/. Next, open up lib/ascii-art.coffee and remove all view code, so it looks like this: {CompositeDisposable} = require 'atom' module.exports = subscriptions: null activate: -&gt; @subscriptions = new CompositeDisposable @subscriptions.add atom.commands.add 'atom-workspace', 'ascii-art:convert': =&gt; @convert() deactivate: -&gt; @subscriptions.dispose() convert: -&gt; console.log 'Convert text!'   Create a Command Now let's add a command. You should namespace your commands with the package name followed by a : and then the name of the command. As you can see in the code, we called our command ascii-art:convert and we will define it to call the convert() method when it's executed. So far, that will simply log to the console. Let's start by making it insert something into the text buffer. convert: -&gt; if editor = atom.workspace.getActiveTextEditor() editor.insertText('Hello, World!')  As in Counting Words, we're using atom.workspace.getActiveTextEditor() to get the object that represents the active text editor. If this convert() method is called when not focused on a text editor, nothing will happen. Next we insert a string into the current text editor with the insertText() method. This will insert the text wherever the cursor currently is in the current editor. If there are selections, it will replace all selections with the \"Hello, World!\" text.  Reload the Package Before we can trigger ascii-art:convert, we need to load the latest code for our package by reloading the window. Run the command \"Window: Reload\" from the Command Palette or by pressing Alt+Cmd+Ctrl+LAlt+Ctrl+R.  Trigger the Command Now open the Command Palette and search for the \"Ascii Art: Convert\" command. But it's not there! To fix this, open package.json and find the property called activationCommands. Activation commands make Atom launch faster by allowing Atom to delay a package's activation until it's needed. So remove the existing command and use ascii-art:convert in activationCommands: \"activationCommands\": { \"atom-workspace\": \"ascii-art:convert\" }  First, reload the window by running the command \"Window: Reload\" from the command palette. Now when you run the \"Ascii Art: Convert\" command it will insert \"Hello, World!\" into the active editor, if any.  Add a Key Binding Now let's add a key binding to trigger the ascii-art:convert command. Open keymaps/ascii-art.cson and add a key binding linking Alt+Ctrl+A to the ascii-art:convert command. You can delete the pre-existing key binding since you won't need it anymore. When finished, the file should look like this: 'atom-text-editor': 'ctrl-alt-a': 'ascii-art:convert'  Now reload the window and verify that the key binding works.  Warning: The Atom keymap system is case-sensitive. This means that there is a distinction between a and A when creating keybindings. a means that you want to trigger the keybinding when you press A. But A means that you want to trigger the keybinding when you press Shift+A. You can also write shift-a when you want to trigger the keybinding when you press Shift+A. We strongly recommend always using lowercase and explicitly spelling out when you want to include Shift in your keybindings.   Add the ASCII Art Now we need to convert the selected text to ASCII art. To do this we will use the figlet Node module from npm. Open package.json and add the latest version of figlet to the dependencies: \"dependencies\": { \"figlet\": \"1.0.8\" }  After saving the file, run the command \"Update Package Dependencies: Update\" from the Command Palette. This will install the package's node module dependencies, only figlet in this case. You will need to run \"Update Package Dependencies: Update\" whenever you update the dependencies field in your package.json file. If for some reason this doesn't work, you'll see a message saying \"Failed to update package dependencies\" and you will find a new npm-debug.log file in your directory. That file should give you some idea as to what went wrong. Now require the figlet node module in lib/ascii-art.coffee and instead of inserting \"Hello, World!\", convert the selected text to ASCII art. convert: -&gt; if editor = atom.workspace.getActiveTextEditor() selection = editor.getSelectedText() figlet = require 'figlet' font = \"O8\" figlet selection, {font: font}, (error, art) -&gt; if error console.error(error) else editor.insertText(\"\\n#{art}\\n\")  Now reload the editor, select some text in an editor window and press Alt+Ctrl+A. It should be replaced with a ridiculous ASCII art version instead. There are a couple of new things in this example we should look at quickly. The first is the editor.getSelectedText() which, as you might guess, returns the text that is currently selected. We then call the Figlet code to convert that into something else and replace the current selection with it with the editor.insertText() call.  Summary In this section, we've made a UI-less package that takes selected text and replaces it with a processed version. This could be helpful in creating linters or checkers for your code.",

You can open the init.coffee file in an editor from the Atom &gt; Init ScriptFile &gt; Init ScriptEdit &gt; Init Script menu. This file can also be named init.js and contain JavaScript code. For example, if you have the Audio Beep configuration setting enabled, you could add the following code to your init.coffee file to have Atom greet you with an audio beep every time it loads: atom.beep()  Because init.coffee provides access to Atom's API, you can use it to implement useful commands without creating a new package or extending an existing one. Here's a command which uses the Selection API and Clipboard API to construct a Markdown link from the selected text and the clipboard contents as the URL: atom.commands.add 'atom-text-editor', 'markdown:paste-as-link', -&gt; return unless editor = atom.workspace.getActiveTextEditor() selection = editor.getLastSelection() clipboardText = atom.clipboard.read() selection.insertText(\"[#{selection.getText()}](#{clipboardText})\")  Now, reload Atom and use the Command Palette to execute the new command, \"Markdown: Paste As Link\", by name.

          "body": " Publishing Atom bundles a command line utility called apm which we first used back in Command Line to search for and install packages via the command line. The apm command can also be used to publish Atom packages to the public registry and update them.  Prepare Your Package There are a few things you should double check before publishing:  Your package.json file has name, description, and repository fields. Your package.json file has a version field with a value of \"0.0.0\". Your package.json file has an engines field that contains an entry for Atom such as: \"engines\": {\"atom\": \"&gt;=1.0.0 &lt;2.0.0\"}. Your package has a README.md file at the root. Your repository URL in the package.json file is the same as the URL of your repository. Your package is in a Git repository that has been pushed to GitHub. Follow this guide if your package isn't already on GitHub.   Publish Your Package Before you publish a package it is a good idea to check ahead of time if a package with the same name has already been published to the atom.io package registry. You can do that by visiting https://atom.io/packages/your-package-name to see if the package already exists. If it does, update your package's name to something that is available before proceeding. Now let's review what the apm publish command does:  Registers the package name on atom.io if it is being published for the first time. Updates the version field in the package.json file and commits it. Creates a new Git tag for the version being published. Pushes the tag and current branch up to GitHub. Updates atom.io with the new version being published.  Now run the following commands to publish your package:  cd path-to-your-package apm publish minor  If this is the first package you are publishing, the apm publish command may prompt you for your GitHub username and password. This is required to publish and you only need to enter this information the first time you publish. The credentials are stored securely in your keychain once you login. Your package is now published and available on atom.io. Head on over to https://atom.io/packages/your-package-name to see your package's page. With apm publish, you can bump the version and publish by using  apm publish   where &lt;version-type&gt; can be major, minor and patch. The major option to the publish command tells apm to increment the first number of the version before publishing so the published version will be 1.0.0 and the Git tag created will be v1.0.0. The minor option to the publish command tells apm to increment the second number of the version before publishing so the published version will be 0.1.0 and the Git tag created will be v0.1.0. The patch option to the publish command tells apm to increment the third number of the version before publishing so the published version will be 0.0.1 and the Git tag created will be v0.0.1. Use major when you make a change that breaks backwards compatibility, like changing defaults or removing features. Use minor when adding new functionality or making improvements on existing code. Use patch when you fix a bug that was causing incorrect behaviour. Check out semantic versioning to learn more about best practices for versioning your package releases. You can also run apm help publish to see all the available options and apm help to see all the other available commands.",

          "body": " Debugging Atom provides several tools to help you understand unexpected behavior and debug problems. This guide describes some of those tools and a few approaches to help you debug and provide more helpful information when submitting issues:  Update to the Latest Version You might be running into an issue which was already fixed in a more recent version of Atom than the one you're using. If you're using released version, check which version of Atom you're using:  atom --version Atom : 1.8.0 Electron: 0.36.8 Chrome : 47.0.2526.110 Node : 5.1.1  Then check for the latest Stable version.  If there is a more recent release available, you can update to the most recent release with the auto-update functionality built in to Atom and the about package. You can open the About View by using the Atom &gt; About menu option to see whether Atom is up-to-date, downloading a new update or click the button to \"Restart and Install Update\".   If there is a more recent release available, you can update to the most recent release with the auto-update functionality built in to Atom and the about package. You can open the About View by using the Help &gt; About menu option to see whether Atom is up-to-date, downloading a new update or click the button to \"Restart and Install Update\".   To update to the latest version, you can download it from the atom.io website or the latest release on GitHub and follow the Installation instructions for Atom on Linux.  If you're building Atom from source, pull down the latest version of master and re-build.  Using Safe Mode A large part of Atom's functionality comes from packages you can install. Atom will also execute the code in your init script on startup. In some cases, these packages and the code in the init script might be causing unexpected behavior, problems, or performance issues. To determine if that is happening, start Atom from the terminal in safe mode:  atom --safe  This starts Atom, but does not load packages from ~/.atom/packages or ~/.atom/dev/packages and disables loading of your init script. If you can no longer reproduce the problem in safe mode, it's likely it was caused by one of the packages or the init script. If removing or commenting out all content from the init script and starting Atom normally still produces the error, then try figuring out which package is causing trouble. Start Atom normally again and open the Settings View with Cmd+,Ctrl+,. Since the Settings View allows you to disable each installed package, you can disable packages one by one until you can no longer reproduce the issue. Restart Atom or reload Atom with Alt+Cmd+Ctrl+LAlt+Ctrl+R after you disable each package to make sure it's completely gone. When you find the problematic package, you can disable or uninstall the package. We strongly recommend creating an issue on the package's GitHub repository. The Atom FAQ has information on how to contact the maintainers of any Atom community package or theme.  Clearing Saved State Atom saves a number of things about your environment when you exit in order to restore Atom to the same configuration when you next launch the program. In some cases the state that gets saved can be something undesirable that prevents Atom from working properly. In these cases, you may want to clear the state that Atom has saved.   Danger: Clearing the saved state permanently destroys any state that Atom has saved across all projects. This includes unsaved changes to files you may have been editing in all projects. This is a destructive action.  Clearing the saved state can be done by opening a terminal and executing:  atom --clear-window-state   Reset to Factory Defaults In some cases, you may want to reset Atom to \"factory defaults\", in other words clear all of your configuration and remove all packages. This can easily be done by opening a terminal and executing:   mv ~/.atom ~/.atom-backup     mv ~/.atom ~/.atom-backup     rename %USERPROFILE%\\.atom .atom-backup   Once that is complete, you can launch Atom as normal. Everything will be just as if you first installed Atom.  Tip: The command given above doesn't delete the old configuration, just puts it somewhere that Atom can't find it. If there are pieces of the old configuration you want to retrieve, you can find them in the ~/.atom-backup%USERPROFILE%\\.atom-backup directory.   Check for Linked Packages If you develop or contribute to Atom packages, there may be left-over packages linked to your ~/.atom/packages or ~/.atom/dev/packages directories. You can use the apm links command to list all linked packages:  apm links /Users/octocat/.atom/dev/packages (0) └── (no links) /Users/octocat/.atom/packages (1) └── color-picker -&gt; /Users/octocat/github/color-picker  You can remove links using the apm unlink command:  apm unlink color-picker Unlinking /Users/octocat/.atom/packages/color-picker ✓  See apm links --help and apm unlink --help for more information on these commands.  Tip: You can also use apm unlink --all to easily unlink all packages and themes.   Check Atom and Package Settings In some cases, unexpected behavior might be caused by settings in Atom or in one of the packages. Open Atom's Settings View with Cmd+,Ctrl+,, the Atom &gt; PreferencesFile &gt; PreferencesEdit &gt; Preferences menu option, or the \"Settings View: Open\" command from the Command Palette.  Check Atom's settings in the Settings View, there's a description of most configuration options the the Basic Customization section. For example, if you want Atom to hide the invisible symbols representing whitespace characters, disable the \"Show Invisibles\" option. Some of these options are also available on a per-language basis which means that they may be different for specific languages, for example JavaScript or Python. To check the per-language settings, open the settings for the language package under the Packages tab in the Settings View, for example the language-javascript or language-python package. Since Atom ships with a set of packages and you can also install additional packages yourself, check the list of packages and their settings. For instance, if you'd like to get rid of the vertical line in the middle of the editor, disable the Wrap Guide package. And if you don't like it when Atom strips trailing whitespace or ensures that there's a single trailing newline in the file, you can configure that in the whitespace package's settings.   Check Your Configuration You might have defined some custom styles, keymaps or snippets in one of your configuration files. In some situations, these personal hacks might be causing the unexpected behavior you're observing so try clearing those files and restarting Atom.  Check Your Keybindings If a command is not executing when you press a key combination or the wrong command is executing, there might be an issue with the keybinding for that combination. Atom ships with the Keybinding Resolver, a neat package which helps you understand what key Atom saw you press and the command that was triggered because of it. Show the keybinding resolver with Cmd+.Ctrl+. or with \"Keybinding Resolver: Show\" from the Command palette. With the Keybinding Resolver shown, press a key combination:  The Keybinding Resolver shows you a list of keybindings that exist for the key combination, where each item in the list has the following:  the command for the keybinding the CSS selector used to define the context in which the keybinding is valid the file in which the keybinding is defined  The keybindings are listed in two colors. All the keybindings that are matched but not executed are shown in gray. The one that is executed, if any, is shown in green. If the command you wanted to trigger isn't listed, then a keybinding for that command hasn't been loaded. If multiple keybindings are matched, Atom determines which keybinding will be executed based on the specificity of the selectors and the order in which they were loaded. If the command you wanted to trigger is listed in the Keybinding Resolver, but wasn't the one that was executed, this is normally explained by one of two causes:   The key combination was not used in the context defined by the keybinding's selector For example, you can't trigger the keybinding for the tree-view:add-file command if the Tree View is not focused.   There is another keybinding that took precedence This often happens when you install a package which defines keybindings that conflict with existing keybindings. If the package's keybindings have selectors with higher specificity or were loaded later, they'll have priority over existing ones.   Atom loads core Atom keybindings and package keybindings first, and user-defined keybindings last. Since user-defined keybindings are loaded last, you can use your keymap.cson file to tweak the keybindings and sort out problems like these. See the Keymaps in Depth section for more information. If you notice that a package's keybindings are taking precedence over core Atom keybindings, it might be a good idea to report the issue on that package's GitHub repository. The Atom FAQ has information on how to contact the maintainers of any Atom community package or theme.  Check Font Rendering Issues You can determine which fonts are being used to render a specific piece of text by using the Developer Tools. To open the Developer Tools press Cmd+Shift+ICtrl+Shift+I. Once the Developer Tools are open, click the \"Elements\" tab. Use the standard tools for finding the element containing the text you want to check. Once you have selected the element, you can click the \"Computed\" tab in the styles pane and scroll to the bottom. The list of fonts being used will be shown there:   Check for Errors in the Developer Tools When an unexpected error occurs Atom, you will normally see a red notification which provides details about the error and allows you to create an issue on the right repository:  If you can reproduce the error, use this approach to get the full stack trace and report the issue.  Note: When running in Dev Mode, the developer tools are automatically shown with the error logged in the Console tab.    Find Crash Logs  When Atom crashes, you will find a crash dump in Console.app. You can launch Console.app using Spotlight or you can find it in /Applications/Utilities/Console.app. Once you have launched the program, you can find the latest crash dump by following these instructions:  Click \"User Reports\" in the left-most column Find the latest entry in the middle column that starts with Atom and ends with .crash   Once you have the crash dump, you can save it to send in later if it is needed for debugging.   When Atom crashes, you will find a crash dump inside your %TEMP%\\Atom Crashes directory. It will be the newest file with the .dmp extension. Once you have the crash dump, you can save it to send in later if it is needed for debugging.   When Atom crashes, it should write a core dump if system settings permit. In order to find whether the core dump is written and to where, consult the documentation for your distribution of Linux. Once you have the core dump, you can save it to send in later if it is needed for debugging.   Diagnose Startup Performance If Atom is taking a long time to start, you can use the Timecop package to get insight into where Atom spends time while loading.  Timecop displays the following information:  Atom startup times File compilation times Package loading and activation times Theme loading and activation times  If a specific package has high load or activation times, you might consider reporting an Issue to the maintainers. You can also disable the package to potentially improve future startup times.  Diagnose Runtime Performance If you're experiencing performance problems in a particular situation, your Issue reports will be more valuable if you include a saved profile from Chrome's CPU profiler that gives some insight into what is slow. To run a profile, open the Developer Tools with Alt+Cmd+IAlt+Ctrl+I. From there:  Click the Profiles tab Select \"Collect JavaScript CPU Profile\" Click \"Start\"   Once that is done, then perform the slow action to capture a recording. When finished, click \"Stop\". Switch to the \"Chart\" view, and a graph of the recorded actions will appear. You can save and post the profile data by clicking \"Save\" next to the profile's name in the left panel.  To learn more, check out the Chrome documentation on CPU profiling.  Profiling Startup Performance If the time for loading the window looks high, you can create a CPU profile for that period using the --profile-startup command line flag when starting Atom:  atom --profile-startup .  This will automatically capture a CPU profile as Atom is loading and open the Developer Tools once Atom loads. From there:  Click the Profiles tab in the Developer Tools Select the \"startup\" profile Click the \"Save\" link for the startup profile  You can then include the startup profile in any Issue you report.  Check Your Build Tools If you are having issues installing a package using apm install, this could be because the package has dependencies on libraries that contain native code. This means you will need to have a C++ compiler and Python installed to be able to install it. You can run apm install --check to see if the Atom package manager can build native code on your machine. Check out the pre-requisites in the build instructions for your platform for more details.",

Since all of Atom is implemented using web technologies, we have to assume you know web technologies such as JavaScript and CSS. Specifically, we'll be implementing everything in CoffeeScript and Less, which are preprocessors for Javascript and CSS respectively. If you don't know CoffeeScript, but you are familiar with JavaScript, you shouldn't have too much trouble. Here is an example of some simple CoffeeScript code: MyPackageView = require './my-package-view' module.exports = myPackageView: null activate: (state) -&gt; @myPackageView = new MyPackageView(state.myPackageViewState) deactivate: -&gt; @myPackageView.destroy() serialize: -&gt; myPackageViewState: @myPackageView.serialize()  We'll go over examples like this in a bit, but this is what the language looks like. Just about everything you can do with CoffeeScript in Atom is also doable in JavaScript. You can brush up on CoffeeScript at coffeescript.org. Less is an even simpler transition from CSS. It adds a number of useful things like variables and functions to CSS. You can learn about Less at lesscss.org. Our usage of Less won't get too complex in this book however, so as long as you know basic CSS you should be fine.",

If so, you're in luck because there are tools to help with the conversion.  Converting a TextMate Grammar Bundle Converting a TextMate bundle will allow you to use its editor preferences, snippets, and colorization inside Atom. Let's convert the TextMate bundle for the R programming language. You can find other existing TextMate bundles on GitHub. You can convert the R bundle with the following command:  apm init --package language-r --convert https://github.com/textmate/r.tmbundle  You can now change directory into language-r to see the converted bundle. Once you link your package with the apm link command, your new package is ready to use. Launch Atom and open a .r file in the editor to see it in action!  Converting a TextMate Syntax Theme This section will go over how to convert a TextMate theme to an Atom theme.  Differences TextMate themes use plist files while Atom themes use CSS or Less to style the UI and syntax in the editor. The utility that converts the theme first parses the theme's plist file and then creates comparable CSS rules and properties that will style Atom similarly.  Convert the Theme Download the theme you wish to convert, you can browse existing TextMate themes on the TextMate website. Now, let's say you've downloaded the theme to ~/Downloads/MyTheme.tmTheme, you can convert the theme with the following command:  apm init --theme my-theme --convert ~/Downloads/MyTheme.tmTheme  You can then change directory to my-theme to see the converted theme.  Activate the Theme Once your theme is installed you can enable it by launching Atom and opening the Settings View with the Atom &gt; PreferencesFile &gt; PreferencesEdit &gt; Preferences menu item. Then select the \"Themes\" tab on the left side navigation. Finally, choose \"My Theme\" from the \"Syntax Theme\" dropdown menu to enable your new theme. Your theme is now enabled, open an editor to see it in action!",

          "body": " Creating a Theme Atom's interface is rendered using HTML, and it's styled via Less which is a superset of CSS. Don't worry if you haven't heard of Less before; it's just like CSS, but with a few handy extensions. Atom supports two types of themes: UI and Syntax. UI themes style elements such as the tree view, the tabs, drop-down lists, and the status bar. Syntax themes style the code, gutter and other elements inside the editor view.  Themes can be installed and changed from the Settings View which you can open by selecting the Atom &gt; PreferencesFile &gt; PreferencesEdit &gt; Preferences menu, and clicking the \"Install\" or \"Themes\" tab on the left hand navigation.  Getting Started Themes are pretty straightforward but it's still helpful to be familiar with a few things before starting:  Less is a superset of CSS, but it has some really handy features like variables. If you aren't familiar with its syntax, take a few minutes to familiarize yourself. You may also want to review the concept of a package.json (as covered in Atom package.json). This file is used to help distribute your theme to Atom users. Your theme's package.json must contain a theme key with a value of ui or syntax for Atom to recognize and load it as a theme. You can find existing themes to install or fork in the atom.io themes registry.   Creating a Syntax Theme Let's create your first theme. To get started, press Cmd+Shift+PCtrl+Shift+P and start typing \"Generate Syntax Theme\" to generate a new theme package. Select \"Generate Syntax Theme,\" and you'll be asked for the path where your theme will be created. Let's call ours motif-syntax.  Tip: Syntax themes should end with -syntax and UI themes should end with -ui.  Atom will display a new window, showing the motif-syntax theme, with a default set of folders and files created for us. If you open the Settings View with Cmd+,Ctrl+, and click the \"Themes\" tab on the left, you'll see the \"Motif\" theme listed in the \"Syntax Theme\" drop-down. Select it from the menu to activate it, now when you open an editor you should see your new motif-syntax theme in action. Open up styles/colors.less to change the various color variables which have already been defined. For example, turn @red into #f4c2c1. Then open styles/base.less and modify the various selectors that have already been defined. These selectors style different parts of code in the editor such as comments, strings and the line numbers in the gutter. As an example, let's make the .gutter background-color into @red. Reload Atom by pressing Alt+Cmd+Ctrl+LAlt+Ctrl+R to see the changes you made reflected in your Atom window. Pretty neat!  Tip: You can avoid reloading to see changes you make by opening an Atom window in Dev Mode. To open a Dev Mode Atom window run atom --dev . in the terminal, or use the View &gt; Developer &gt; Open in Dev Mode menu. When you edit your theme, changes will instantly be reflected!   Note: It's advised to not specify a font-family in your syntax theme because it will override the Font Family field in Atom's settings. If you still like to recommend a font that goes well with your theme, we suggest you do so in your README.   Creating a UI Theme To create a UI theme, do the following:  Fork the ui-theme-template  Clone the forked repository to the local filesystem Open a terminal in the forked theme's directory Open your new theme in a Dev Mode Atom window run atom --dev . in the terminal or use the View &gt; Developer &gt; Open in Dev Mode menu Change the name of the theme in the theme's package.json file Name your theme end with a -ui, for example super-white-ui  Run apm link --dev to symlink your repository to ~/.atom/dev/packages  Reload Atom using Alt+Cmd+Ctrl+LAlt+Ctrl+R  Enable the theme via the \"UI Theme\" drop-down in the \"Themes\" tab of the Settings View Make changes! Since you opened the theme in a Dev Mode window, changes will be instantly reflected in the editor without having to reload.   Tip: Because we used apm link --dev in the above instructions, if you break anything you can always close Atom and launch Atom normally to force Atom to the default theme. This allows you to continue working on your theme even if something goes catastrophically wrong.   Theme Variables UI themes must provide a ui-variables.less and Syntax themes a syntax-variables.less file. It contains predefined variables that packages use to make sure the look and feel matches. Here the variables with the default values:  ui-variables.less syntax-variables.less  These default values will be used as a fallback in case a theme doesn't define its own variables.  Use in Packages In any of your package's .less files, you can access the theme variables by importing the ui-variables or syntax-variables file from Atom. Your package should generally only specify structural styling, and these should come from the style guide. Your package shouldn't specify colors, padding sizes, or anything in absolute pixels. You should instead use the theme variables. If you follow this guideline, your package will look good out of the box with any theme! Here's an example .less file that a package can define using theme variables: @import \"ui-variables\"; .my-selector { background-color: @base-background-color; padding: @component-padding; }  @import \"syntax-variables\"; .my-selector { background-color: @syntax-background-color; }   Development workflow There are a few tools to help make theme development faster and easier.  Live Reload Reloading by pressing Alt+Cmd+Ctrl+LAlt+Ctrl+R after you make changes to your theme is less than ideal. Atom supports live updating of styles on Atom windows in Dev Mode. To launch a Dev Mode window:  Open your theme directory in a dev window by selecting the View &gt; Developer &gt; Open in Dev Mode menu item Or launch Atom from the terminal with atom --dev   If you'd like to reload all the styles at any time, you can use the shortcut Alt+Cmd+Ctrl+LAlt+Ctrl+R.  Developer Tools Atom is based on the Chrome browser, and supports Chrome's Developer Tools. You can open them by selecting the View &gt; Developer &gt; Toggle Developer Tools menu, or by using the Alt+Cmd+IAlt+Ctrl+I shortcut. The dev tools allow you to inspect elements and take a look at their CSS properties.  Check out Google's extensive tutorial for a short introduction.  Atom Styleguide If you are creating an UI theme, you'll want a way to see how your theme changes affect all the components in the system. The Styleguide is a page that renders every component Atom supports. To open the Styleguide, open the command palette with Cmd+Shift+PCtrl+Shift+P and search for \"styleguide\", or use the shortcut Cmd+Ctrl+Shift+GCtrl+Shift+G.   Side by side Sometimes when creating a theme (or package) things can go wrong and the editor becomes un-usable. E.g. if the text and background have the same color or something gets pushed out of sight. To avoid having to open Atom in \"normal\" mode to fix the issue, it's advised to open two Atom windows. One for making changes and one in Dev Mode to see the changes getting applied.   Make changes on the left, see the changes getting applied in \"Dev Mode\" on the right.  Now if you mess up something, only the window in \"Dev Mode\" will be affected and you can easily correct the mistake in your \"normal\" window.  Publish your theme Once you're happy with your theme and would like to share it with other Atom users, it's time to publish it.  Follow the steps on the Publishing page. The example used is for the Word Count package, but publishing a theme works exactly the same.",

Symlinks File symlinks can be used on Windows by non-Administrators by specifying 'junction' as the type (this argument is ignored on macOS &amp; Linux). Also consider:   Symlinks committed to Git will not checkout correctly on Windows - dynamically create what you need with fs.symlink instead   Symlinked directories are only available to Administrators on Windows - avoid a dependency on them    Filenames   Reserved filenames on Windows are com1-com9, lpt1-lpt9, con, nul, aux and prn (regardless of extension, e.g. prn.txt is disallowed)  Reserved characters on Windows are ? \\ / &lt; &gt; ? % | : \" so avoid where possible   Names with spaces when passed to the command line;  Windows requires you surround the path with double quotes e.g. \"c:\\my test\"  macOS and Linux require a backslash before each space e.g. /my\\ test      File paths  Windows uses \\ although some tools and PowerShell allow / too macOS and Linux use /   You can dynamically find out what your platform uses with path.sep or better yet use the node path library functions such as join and normalize which automatically take care of this. Windows supports up to 250 characters for a path - avoid deeply nested directory structures  Paths are not URLs URL parsing routines should not be used on file paths. While they initially look like a relative path it will fail in a number of scenarios on all platforms.  Various characters are misinterpreted, e.g. ? as query string, # as a fragment identifier  Windows drive specifiers are incorrectly parsed as a protocol  If you need to use a path for a URL use the file: protocol with an absolute path instead to ensure drive letters and slashes are appropriately addressed, e.g. file:///c|/test/pic.png  fs.stat on directories The fs.stat function does not return the size of the contents of a directory but rather the allocation size of the directory itself. This returns 0 on Windows and 1024 on macOS and so should not be relied upon.  path.relative can't traverse drives  On a macOS or Linux system path.relative can be used to calculate a relative path to traverse between any two given paths. On Windows this is not always possible as it can contain multiple absolute roots, e.g. c:\\ and d:\\    Rapid file operations Creation and deletion operations may take a few milliseconds to complete. If you need to remove many files and folders consider RimRAF which has built-in retry logic for this.  Line endings  Windows uses CRLF  macOS and Linux use LF  Git on Windows often has autocrlf set which automatically converts between the two  If you are writing specs that use text file fixtures consider that this will interfere with file lengths, hash codes and direct text comparisons. It will also change the Atom selection length by 1 character per line. If you have spec fixtures that are text files you may want to tell Git to force LF, CRLF or not convert them by specifying the paths in .gitattributes e.g. spec/fixtures/always-crlf.txt eol=crlf spec/fixtures/always-lf.txt eol=lf spec/fixtures/leave-as-is.txt -text ",

          "body": " Writing Specs We've looked at and written a few specs through the examples already. Now it's time to take a closer look at the spec framework itself. How exactly do you write tests in Atom? Atom uses Jasmine as its spec framework. Any new functionality should have specs to guard against regressions.  Create a New Spec Atom specs and package specs are added to their respective spec directory. The example below creates a spec for Atom core.  Create a Spec File Spec files must end with -spec so add sample-spec.coffee to the spec directory.  Add One or More describe Methods The describe method takes two arguments, a description and a function. If the description explains a behavior it typically begins with when; if it is more like a unit test it begins with the method name. describe \"when a test is written\", -&gt; # contents  or describe \"Editor::moveUp\", -&gt; # contents   Add One or More it Methods The it method also takes two arguments, a description and a function. Try and make the description flow with the it method. For example, a description of \"this should work\" doesn't read well as \"it this should work\". But a description of \"should work\" sounds great as \"it should work\". describe \"when a test is written\", -&gt; it \"has some expectations that should pass\", -&gt; # Expectations   Add One or More Expectations The best way to learn about expectations is to read the Jasmine documentation about them. Below is a simple example. describe \"when a test is written\", -&gt; it \"has some expectations that should pass\", -&gt; expect(\"apples\").toEqual(\"apples\") expect(\"oranges\").not.toEqual(\"apples\")   Custom Matchers In addition to the Jasmine's built-in matchers, Atom includes the following:  jasmine-jquery The toBeInstanceOf matcher is for the instanceof operator The toHaveLength matcher compares against the .length property The toExistOnDisk matcher checks if the file exists in the filesystem The toHaveFocus matcher checks if the element currently has focus The toShow matcher tests if the element is visible in the dom  These are defined in spec/spec-helper.coffee.  Asynchronous Specs Writing Asynchronous specs can be tricky at first. Some examples.  Promises Working with promises is rather easy in Atom. You can use our waitsForPromise function. describe \"when we open a file\", -&gt; it \"should be opened in an editor\", -&gt; waitsForPromise -&gt; atom.workspace.open('c.coffee').then (editor) -&gt; expect(editor.getPath()).toContain 'c.coffee'  This method can be used in the describe, it, beforeEach and afterEach functions. describe \"when we open a file\", -&gt; beforeEach -&gt; waitsForPromise -&gt; atom.workspace.open 'c.coffee' it \"should be opened in an editor\", -&gt; expect(atom.workspace.getActiveTextEditor().getPath()).toContain 'c.coffee'  If you need to wait for multiple promises use a new waitsForPromise function for each promise. (Caution: Without beforeEach this example will fail!) describe \"waiting for the packages to load\", -&gt; beforeEach -&gt; waitsForPromise -&gt; atom.workspace.open('sample.js') waitsForPromise -&gt; atom.packages.activatePackage('tabs') waitsForPromise -&gt; atom.packages.activatePackage('tree-view') it 'should have waited long enough', -&gt; expect(atom.packages.isPackageActive('tabs')).toBe true expect(atom.packages.isPackageActive('tree-view')).toBe true   Asynchronous Functions with Callbacks Specs for asynchronous functions can be done using the waitsFor and runs functions. A simple example. describe \"fs.readdir(path, cb)\", -&gt; it \"is async\", -&gt; spy = jasmine.createSpy('fs.readdirSpy') fs.readdir('/tmp/example', spy) waitsFor -&gt; spy.callCount &gt; 0 runs -&gt; exp = [null, ['example.coffee']] expect(spy.mostRecentCall.args).toEqual exp expect(spy).toHaveBeenCalledWith(null, ['example.coffee'])  For a more detailed documentation on asynchronous tests please visit the Jasmine documentation.  Running Specs Most of the time you'll want to run specs by triggering the window:run-package-specs command. This command is not only to run package specs, it can also be used to run Atom core specs when working on Atom itself. This will run all the specs in the current project's spec directory. To run a limited subset of specs use the fdescribe or fit methods. You can use those to focus a single spec or several specs. Modified from the example above, focusing an individual spec looks like this: describe \"when a test is written\", -&gt; fit \"has some expectations that should pass\", -&gt; expect(\"apples\").toEqual(\"apples\") expect(\"oranges\").not.toEqual(\"apples\")   Running on CI It is now easy to run the specs in a CI environment like Travis and AppVeyor. See the Travis CI For Your Packages and AppVeyor CI For Your Packages posts for more details.  Running via the Command Line To run tests on the command line, run Atom with the --test flag followed by one or more paths to test files or directories. You can also specify a --timeout option, which will force-terminate your tests after a certain number of seconds have passed.  atom --test --timeout 60 ./test/test-1.js ./test/test-2.js   Customizing your test runner  Warning: This API is available as of 1.2.0-beta0, and it is experimental and subject to change. Test runner authors should be prepared to test their code against future beta releases until it stabilizes.  By default, package tests are run with Jasmine 1.3, which is outdated but can't be changed for compatibility reasons. You can specify your own custom test runner by including an atomTestRunner field in your package.json. Atom will require whatever module you specify in this field, so you can use a relative path or the name of a module in your package's dependencies. Your test runner module must export a single function, which Atom will call within a new window to run your package's tests. Your function will be called with the following parameters:   testPaths An array of paths to tests to run. Could be paths to files or directories.  buildAtomEnvironment A function that can be called to construct an instance of the atom global. No atom global will be explicitly assigned, but you can assign one in your runner if desired. This function should be called with the following parameters:   applicationDelegate An object responsible for Atom's interaction with the browser process and host OS. Use buildDefaultApplicationDelegate for a default instance. You can override specific methods on this object to prevent or test these interactions.  window A window global.  document A document global.  configDirPath A path to the configuration directory (usually ~/.atom).  enablePersistence A boolean indicating whether the Atom environment should save or load state from the file system. You probably want this to be false.    buildDefaultApplicationDelegate A function that builds a default instance of the application delegate, suitable to be passed as the applicationDelegate parameter to buildAtomEnvironment.  logFile An optional path to a log file to which test output should be logged.  headless A boolean indicating whether or not the tests are being run from the command line via atom --test.  legacyTestRunner This function can be invoked to run the legacy Jasmine runner, giving your package a chance to transition to a new test runner while maintaining a subset of its tests in the old environment.  Your function should return a promise that resolves to an exit code when your tests are finish running. This exit code will be returned when running your tests via the command line.",

          "body": " Package: Word Count Let's get started by writing a very simple package and looking at some of the tools needed to develop one effectively. We'll start by writing a package that tells you how many words are in the current buffer and display it in a small modal window.  Package Generator The simplest way to start a package is to use the built-in package generator that ships with Atom. As you might expect by now, this generator is itself a separate package implemented in package-generator. You can run the generator by invoking the command palette and searching for \"Generate Package\". A dialog will appear asking you to name your new project. Name it your-name-word-count. Atom will then create that directory and fill it out with a skeleton project and link it into your ~/.atom/packages%USERPROFILE%\\.atom\\packages directory so it's loaded when you launch your editor next time.  Note: You may encounter a situation where your package is not loaded. That is because a new package using the same name as an actual package hosted on atom.io (e.g. \"wordcount\" and \"word-count\") is not being loaded as you expected. If you follow our suggestion above of using the your-name-word-count package name, you should be safe    You can see that Atom has created about a dozen files that make up the package. Let's take a look at each of them to get an idea of how a package is structured, then we can modify them to get our word count functionality. The basic package layout is as follows: my-package/ ├─ grammars/ ├─ keymaps/ ├─ lib/ ├─ menus/ ├─ spec/ ├─ snippets/ ├─ styles/ ├─ index.coffee └─ package.json  Not every package will have (or need) all of these directories and the package generator doesn't create snippets or grammars. Let's see what some of these are so we can start messing with them.  package.json  Similar to Node modules, Atom packages contain a package.json file in their top-level directory. This file contains metadata about the package, such as the path to its \"main\" module, library dependencies, and manifests specifying the order in which its resources should be loaded. In addition to some of the regular Node package.json keys available, Atom package.json files have their own additions.   main: the path to the CoffeeScript file that's the entry point to your package. If this is missing, Atom will default to looking for an index.coffee or index.js.  styles: an Array of Strings identifying the order of the style sheets your package needs to load. If not specified, style sheets in the styles directory are added alphabetically.  keymaps: an Array of Strings identifying the order of the key mappings your package needs to load. If not specified, mappings in the keymaps directory are added alphabetically.  menus: an Array of Strings identifying the order of the menu mappings your package needs to load. If not specified, mappings in the menus directory are added alphabetically.  snippets: an Array of Strings identifying the order of the snippets your package needs to load. If not specified, snippets in the snippets directory are added alphabetically.  activationCommands: an Object identifying commands that trigger your package's activation. The keys are CSS selectors, the values are Arrays of Strings identifying the command. The loading of your package is delayed until one of these events is triggered within the associated scope defined by the CSS selector. If not specified, the activate() method of your main export will be called when your package is loaded.  activationHooks: an Array of Strings identifying hooks that trigger your package's activation. The loading of your package is delayed until one of these hooks are triggered. Currently, the only activation hook is language-package-name:grammar-used (e.g., language-javascript:grammar-used)  The package.json in the package we've just generated looks like this currently: { \"name\": \"wordcount\", \"main\": \"./lib/wordcount\", \"version\": \"0.0.0\", \"description\": \"A short description of your package\", \"activationCommands\": { \"atom-workspace\": \"wordcount:toggle\" }, \"repository\": \"https://github.com/atom/your-name-word-count\", \"license\": \"MIT\", \"engines\": { \"atom\": \"&gt;=1.0.0 &lt;2.0.0\" }, \"dependencies\": { } }  If you wanted to use activationHooks, you might have: { \"name\": \"wordcount\", \"main\": \"./lib/wordcount\", \"version\": \"0.0.0\", \"description\": \"A short description of your package\", \"activationHooks\": [\"language-javascript:grammar-used\", \"language-coffee-script:grammar-used\"], \"repository\": \"https://github.com/atom/your-name-word-count\", \"license\": \"MIT\", \"engines\": { \"atom\": \"&gt;=1.0.0 &lt;2.0.0\" }, \"dependencies\": { } }  One of the first things you should do is ensure that this information is filled out. The name, description, repository URL the project will be at, and the license can all be filled out immediately. The other information we'll get into more detail on as we go.  Warning: Do not forget to update the repository URL. The one generated for you is invalid by design and will prevent you from publishing your package until updated.   Source Code If you want to extend Atom's behavior, your package should contain a single top-level module, which you export from whichever file is indicated by the main key in your package.json file. In the package we just generated, the main package file is lib/wordcount.coffee. The remainder of your code should be placed in the lib directory, and required from your top-level file. If the main key is not in your package.json file, it will look for index.coffee or index.js as the main entry point. Your package's top-level module is a singleton object that manages the lifecycle of your extensions to Atom. Even if your package creates ten different views and appends them to different parts of the DOM, it's all managed from your top-level object. Your package's top-level module can implement the following basic methods:   activate(state): This optional method is called when your package is activated. It is passed the state data from the last time the window was serialized if your module implements the serialize() method. Use this to do initialization work when your package is started (like setting up DOM elements or binding events).  initialize(state): This optional method is similar to activate() but is called earlier. Whereas activation occurs after the workspace has been deserialized (and can therefore happen after your package's deserializers have been called), initialize() is guaranteed to be called before everything. Use activate() if you want to be sure that the workspace is ready; use initialize() if you need to do some setup prior to your deserializers or view providers being invoked.  serialize(): This optional method is called when the window is shutting down, allowing you to return JSON to represent the state of your component. When the window is later restored, the data you returned is passed to your module's activate method so you can restore your view to where the user left off.  deactivate(): This optional method is called when the window is shutting down. If your package is watching any files or holding external resources in any other way, release them here. If you're just subscribing to things on window, you don't need to worry because that's getting torn down anyway.   Style Sheets Style sheets for your package should be placed in the styles directory. Any style sheets in this directory will be loaded and attached to the DOM when your package is activated. Style sheets can be written as CSS or Less, but Less is recommended. Ideally, you won't need much in the way of styling. Atom provides a standard set of components which define both the colors and UI elements for any package that fits into Atom seamlessly. You can view all of Atom's UI components by opening the styleguide: open the command palette Cmd+Shift+PCtrl+Shift+P and search for styleguide, or type Cmd+Ctrl+Shift+GCtrl+Shift+G. If you do need special styling, try to keep only structural styles in the package style sheets. If you must specify colors and sizing, these should be taken from the active theme's ui-variables.less. An optional styleSheets array in your package.json can list the style sheets by name to specify a loading order; otherwise, style sheets are loaded alphabetically.  Keymaps You can provide key bindings for commonly used actions for your extension, especially if you're also adding a new command. In our new package, we have a keymap filled in for us already in the keymaps/wordcount.cson file: 'atom-workspace': 'ctrl-alt-o': 'wordcount:toggle'  This means that if you press Alt+Ctrl+O, our package will run the your-name-word-count:toggle command. We'll look at that code next, but if you want to change the default key mapping, you can do that in this file. Keymaps are placed in the keymaps subdirectory. By default, all keymaps are loaded in alphabetical order. An optional keymaps array in your package.json can specify which keymaps to load and in what order. Keybindings are executed by determining which element the keypress occurred on. In the example above, the your-name-word-count:toggle command is executed when pressing Alt+Ctrl+O on the atom-workspace element. Because the atom-workspace element is the parent of the entire Atom UI, this means the key combination will work anywhere in the application. We'll cover more advanced keybinding stuff a bit later in Keymaps in Depth.  Menus Menus are placed in the menus subdirectory. This defines menu elements like what pops up when you right click a context-menu or would go in the application menu to trigger functionality in your plugin. By default, all menus are loaded in alphabetical order. An optional menus array in your package.json can specify which menus to load and in what order.  Application Menu It's recommended that you create an application menu item under the Packages menu for common actions with your package that aren't tied to a specific element. If we look in the menus/your-name-word-count.cson file that was generated for us, we'll see a section that looks like this: 'menu': [ { 'label': 'Packages' 'submenu': [ 'label': 'Word Count' 'submenu': [ { 'label': 'Toggle' 'command': 'your-name-word-count:toggle' } ] ] } ]  This section puts a \"Toggle\" menu item under a menu group named \"Your Name Word Count\" in the \"Packages\" menu.  When you select that menu item, it will run the your-name-word-count:toggle command, which we'll look at in a bit. The menu templates you specify are merged with all other templates provided by other packages in the order which they were loaded.  Context Menu It's recommended to specify a context menu item for commands that are linked to specific parts of the interface. In our menus/your-name-word-count.cson file, we can see an auto-generated section that looks like this: 'context-menu': 'atom-text-editor': [ { 'label': 'Toggle Word Count' 'command': 'your-name-word-count:toggle' } ]  This adds a \"Toggle Word Count\" menu option to the menu that pops up when you right-click in an Atom text editor pane.  When you click that it will again run the your-name-word-count:toggle method in your code. Context menus are created by determining which element was selected and then adding all of the menu items whose selectors match that element (in the order which they were loaded). The process is then repeated for the elements until reaching the top of the DOM tree. You can also add separators and submenus to your context menus. To add a submenu, provide a submenu key instead of a command. To add a separator, add an item with a single type: 'separator' key/value pair. For instance, you could do something like this: 'context-menu': 'atom-workspace': [ { label: 'Text' submenu: [ {label: 'Inspect Element', command: 'core:inspect'} {type: 'separator'} {label: 'Selector All', command: 'core:select-all'} {type: 'separator'} {label: 'Deleted Selected Text', command: 'core:delete'} ] } ]   Developing Our Package Currently with the generated package we have, if we run that your-name-word-count:toggle command through the menu or the command palette, we'll get a dialog that says \"The Wordcount package is Alive! It's ALIVE!\".   Understanding the Generated Code Let's take a look at the code in our lib directory and see what is happening. There are two files in our lib directory. One is the main file (lib/your-name-word-count.coffee), which is pointed to in the package.json file as the main file to execute for this package. This file handles the logic of the whole plugin. The second file is a View class, lib/your-name-word-count-view.coffee, which handles the UI elements of the package. Let's look at this file first, since it's pretty simple. module.exports = class YourNameWordCountView constructor: (serializedState) -&gt; # Create root element  @element = document.createElement('div') @element.classList.add('your-name-word-count') # Create message element  message = document.createElement('div') message.textContent = \"The Your Name Word Count package is Alive! It's ALIVE!\" message.classList.add('message') @element.appendChild(message) # Returns an object that can be retrieved when package is activated  serialize: -&gt; # Tear down any state and detach  destroy: -&gt; @element.remove() getElement: -&gt; @element  Basically the only thing happening here is that when the View class is created, it creates a simple div element and adds the your-name-word-count class to it (so we can find or style it later) and then adds the \"Your Name Word Count package is Alive!\" text to it. There is also a getElement method which returns that div. The serialize and destroy methods don't do anything and we won't have to worry about that until another example. Notice that we're simply using the basic browser DOM methods: createElement() and appendChild(). The second file we have is the main entry point to the package. Again, because it's referenced in the package.json file. Let's take a look at that file. YourNameWordCountView = require './your-name-word-count-view' {CompositeDisposable} = require 'atom' module.exports = YourNameWordCount = yourNameWordCountView: null modalPanel: null subscriptions: null activate: (state) -&gt; @yourNameWordCountView = new YourNameWordCountView(state.yourNameWordCountViewState) @modalPanel = atom.workspace.addModalPanel(item: @yourNameWordCountView.getElement(), visible: false) # Events subscribed to in atom's system can be easily cleaned up with a CompositeDisposable  @subscriptions = new CompositeDisposable # Register command that toggles this view  @subscriptions.add atom.commands.add 'atom-workspace', 'your-name-word-count:toggle': =&gt; @toggle() deactivate: -&gt; @modalPanel.destroy() @subscriptions.dispose() @wordcountView.destroy() serialize: -&gt; yourNameWordCountViewState: @yourNameWordCountView.serialize() toggle: -&gt; console.log 'YourNameWordCount was toggled!' if @modalPanel.isVisible() @modalPanel.hide() else @modalPanel.show()  There is a bit more going on here. First of all we can see that we are defining four methods. The only required one is activate. The deactivate and serialize methods are expected by Atom but optional. The toggle method is one Atom is not looking for, so we'll have to invoke it somewhere for it to be called, which you may recall we do both in the activationCommands section of the package.json file and in the action we have in the menu file. The deactivate method simply destroys the various class instances we've created and the serialize method simply passes on the serialization to the View class. Nothing too exciting here. The activate command does a number of things. For one, it is not called automatically when Atom starts up, it is first called when one of the activationCommands as defined in the package.json file are called. In this case, activate is only called the first time the toggle command is called. If nobody ever invokes the menu item or hotkey, this code is never called. This method does two things. The first is that it creates an instance of the View class we have and adds the element that it creates to a hidden modal panel in the Atom workspace. @yourNameWordCountView = new YourNameWordCountView(state.yourNameWordCountViewState) @modalPanel = atom.workspace.addModalPanel( item: @yourNameWordCountView.getElement(), visible: false )  We'll ignore the state stuff for now, since it's not important for this simple plugin. The rest should be fairly straightforward. The next thing this method does is create an instance of the CompositeDisposable class so it can register all the commands that can be called from the plugin so other plugins could subscribe to these events. # Events subscribed to in atom's system can be easily cleaned up with a CompositeDisposable @subscriptions = new CompositeDisposable # Register command that toggles this view @subscriptions.add atom.commands.add 'atom-workspace', 'your-name-word-count:toggle': =&gt; @toggle()  Next we have the toggle method. This method simply toggles the visibility of the modal panel that we created in the activate method. toggle: -&gt; console.log 'YourNameWordCount was toggled!' if @modalPanel.isVisible() @modalPanel.hide() else @modalPanel.show()  This should be fairly simple to understand. We're looking to see if the modal element is visible and hiding or showing it depending on it's current state.  The Flow So, let's review the actual flow in this package.  Atom starts up Atom starts loading packages Atom reads your package.json  Atom loads keymaps, menus, styles and the main module Atom finishes loading packages At some point, the user executes your package command your-name-word-count:toggle  Atom executes the activate method in your main module which sets up the UI by creating the hidden modal view Atom executes the package command your-name-word-count:toggle which reveals the hidden modal view At some point, the user executes the your-name-word-count:toggle command again Atom executes the command which hides the modal view Eventually, Atom is shut down which can trigger any serializations that your package has defined   Tip: Keep in mind that the flow will be slightly different if you choose not to use activationCommands in your package.   Counting the Words So now that we understand what is happening, let's modify the code so that our little modal box shows us the current word count instead of static text. We'll do this in a very simple way. When the dialog is toggled, we'll count the words right before displaying the modal. So let's do this in the toggle command. If we add some code to count the words and ask the view to update itself, we'll have something like this: toggle: -&gt; if @modalPanel.isVisible() @modalPanel.hide() else editor = atom.workspace.getActiveTextEditor() words = editor.getText().split(/\\s+/).length @yourNameWordCountView.setCount(words) @modalPanel.show()  Let's look at the 3 lines we've added. First we get an instance of the current editor object (where our text to count is) by calling atom.workspace.getActiveTextEditor(). Next we get the number of words by calling getText() on our new editor object, then splitting that text on whitespace with a regular expression and then getting the length of that array. Finally, we tell our view to update the word count it displays by calling the setCount() method on our view and then showing the modal again. Since that method doesn't yet exist, let's create it now. We can add this code to the end of our your-name-word-count-view.coffee file: setCount: (count) -&gt; displayText = \"There are #{count} words.\" @element.children[0].textContent = displayText  Pretty simple! We take the count number that was passed in and place it into a string that we then stick into the element that our view is controlling.   Basic Debugging You'll notice a few console.log statements in the code. One of the cool things about Atom being built on Chromium is that you can use some of the same debugging tools available to you that you have when doing web development. To open up the Developer Console, press Alt+Cmd+ICtrl+Shift+I, or choose the menu option View &gt; Developer &gt; Toggle Developer Tools.  From here you can inspect objects, run code and view console output just as though you were debugging a web site.  Testing Your package should have tests, and if they're placed in the spec directory, they can be run by Atom. Under the hood, Jasmine v1.3 executes your tests, so you can assume that any DSL available there is also available to your package.  Running Tests Once you've got your test suite written, you can run it by pressing Alt+Cmd+Ctrl+PAlt+Ctrl+P or via the View &gt; Developer &gt; Run Package Specs menu. Our generated package comes with an example test suite, so you can run this right now to see what happens.  You can also use the atom --test spec command to run them from the command line. It prints the test output and results to the console and returns the proper status code depending on whether the tests passed or failed.  Summary We've now generated, customized and tested our first plugin for Atom. Congratulations! Now let's go ahead and publish it so it's available to the world.",

Usage Atom's usage of the Octicons differs just a bit from the standard way. The biggest difference is in the naming of the icon classes. Instead of the octicon octicon- prefix, you would use a more generic icon icon- prefix. As an example, to add a monitor icon, use the icon icon-device-desktop classes in your markup: &lt;span class=\"icon icon-device-desktop\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;   Overview To see an overview of all icons open the Styleguide. Under the \"Icons\" section you'll find all the Octicons that are available.   Size Octicons look best with a font-size of 16px. It's already used as the default, so you don't need to worry about it. In case you prefer a different icon size, try to use multiples of 16 (32px, 48px etc.) for the sharpest result. Sizes in between are ok too, but might look a bit blurry for icons with straight lines.  Usability Although icons can make your UI visually appealing, when used without a text label, it can be hard to guess its meaning. In cases where space for a text label is insufficient, consider adding a tooltip that appears on hover. Or a more subtle title=\"label\" attribute would help as well.",

It's basically the same as a file for most descriptions, but it's the version Atom has in memory. For instance, you can change the text of a buffer and it isn't written to its associated file until you save it.  Command A command is a bit of functionality in Atom that can be triggered by the user either through a keybinding or a menu item.  Key Combination A key combination is some combination or sequence of keys that are pressed to perform a task. Examples:  A Ctrl+Enter  Ctrl+K Right    Key Sequence A key sequence is a special case of a key combination. It is a key combination that consists of keys that must be pressed and released in sequence. Ctrl+K Down is a key sequence. Alt+S is not a key sequence because it is two keys that are pressed and released together rather than in succession.  Keybinding A keybinding is the mapping of a key combination, such as Ctrl+Enter to an Atom command.  Keymap A keymap is a collection of keybindings. It can also refer to a file or files containing keybindings for an Atom package or Atom itself.  Package An Atom plugin. There is a bunch more information in the section on Atom Packages.  Pane A pane is a visual section of the editor space. Each pane can hold multiple pane items. There is always at least one pane in each Atom window.  Pane Item Some item, often an editor, that is displayed within a pane. In the default configuration of Atom, pane items are represented by tabs at the top of each pane.  Note: The reason why we don't call them \"tabs\" is because you can disable the tabs package and then there aren't any tabs. For a similar reason, we don't call them files because some things can be shown in a pane that aren't files, like the Settings View.   Panel A piece of the Atom UI that is outside the editor space.

Perhaps there is a keybinding that you use a lot but feels wrong or a color that isn't quite right for you. Atom is amazingly flexible, so let's go over some of the simpler flexes it can do.  Configuring with CSON All of Atom's config files (with the exception of your style sheet and your Init Script) are written in CSON, short for CoffeeScript Object Notation. Just like its namesake JSON, JavaScript Object Notation, CSON is a text format for storing structured data in the form of simple objects made up of key-value pairs. key: key: value key: value key: [value, value]  Objects are the backbone of any CSON file, and are delineated by indentation (as in the above example). A key's value can either be a String, a Number, an Object, a Boolean, null, or an Array of any of these data types.  Just like the more common JSON, CSON's keys can only be repeated once per object. If there are duplicate keys, then the last usage of that key overwrites all others, as if they weren't there. The same holds true for Atom's config files. Don't do this: # Only the second snippet will be loaded '.source.js': 'console.log': 'prefix': 'log' 'body': 'console.log(${1:\"crash\"});$2' '.source.js': 'console.error': 'prefix': 'error' 'body': 'console.error(${1:\"crash\"});$2'  Use this instead: # Both snippets will be loaded '.source.js': 'console.log': 'prefix': 'log' 'body': 'console.log(${1:\"crash\"});$2' 'console.error': 'prefix': 'error' 'body': 'console.error(${1:\"crash\"});$2'    Style Tweaks If you want to apply quick-and-dirty personal styling changes without creating an entire theme that you intend to publish, you can add styles to the styles.less file in your ~/.atom%USERPROFILE%\\.atom directory. You can open this file in an editor from the Atom &gt; StylesheetFile &gt; StylesheetEdit &gt; Stylesheet menu.    For example, to change the colors of the Status Bar, you could add the following rule to your styles.less file: .status-bar { color: white; background-color: black; }  The easiest way to see what classes are available to style is to inspect the DOM manually via the Developer Tools. We'll go over the Developer Tools in great detail in the next chapter, but for now let's take a simple look. You can open the Developer Tools by pressing Alt+Cmd+IAlt+Ctrl+ICtrl+Shift+I, which will bring up the Chromium Developer Tools panel.  With the Developer Tools, you can inspect all the elements in Atom. If you want to update the style of something, you can figure out what classes it has and add a Less rule to your stylesheet to modify it.  If you are unfamiliar with Less, it is a basic CSS preprocessor that makes some things in CSS a bit easier. You can learn more about it at lesscss.org. If you prefer to use CSS instead, you can do that in the same styles.less file, since CSS is also valid in Less.   Customizing Keybindings Atom keymaps work similarly to stylesheets. Just as stylesheets use selectors to apply styles to elements, Atom keymaps use selectors to associate key combinations with events in specific contexts. Here's a small example, excerpted from Atom's built-in keymap: 'atom-text-editor': 'enter': 'editor:newline' 'atom-text-editor[mini] input': 'enter': 'core:confirm'  This keymap defines the meaning of Enter in two different contexts. In a normal editor, pressing Enter triggers the editor:newline command, which causes the editor to insert a newline. But if the same keystroke occurs inside a select list's mini-editor, it instead triggers the core:confirm command based on the binding in the more-specific selector. By default, keymap.cson is loaded when Atom is started. It will always be loaded last, giving you the chance to override bindings that are defined by Atom's core keymaps or third-party packages. You can open this file in an editor from the Atom &gt; KeymapFile &gt; KeymapEdit &gt; Keymap menu. You can see all the keybindings that are currently configured in your installation of Atom in the Keybindings tab in the Settings View. If you run into problems with keybindings, the Keybinding Resolver is a huge help. It can be opened with the Cmd+.Ctrl+. key combination. It will show you what keys Atom saw you press and what command Atom executed because of that combination.  Global Configuration Settings Atom loads configuration settings from the config.cson file in your ~/.atom%USERPROFILE%\\.atom directory. '*': 'core': 'excludeVcsIgnoredPaths': true 'editor': 'fontSize': 18  The configuration is grouped into global settings under the * key and language-specific settings under scope named keys like .python.source or .html.text. Underneath that, you'll find configuration settings grouped by package name or one of the two core namespaces: core or editor. You can open this file in an editor from the Atom &gt; ConfigFile &gt; ConfigEdit &gt; Config menu.  Configuration Key Reference   core   customFileTypes: Associations of language scope to file extensions (see Customizing Language Recognition)  disabledPackages: An array of package names to disable  excludeVcsIgnoredPaths: Don't search within files specified by .gitignore   ignoredNames: File names to ignore across all of Atom  projectHome: The directory where projects are assumed to be located  themes: An array of theme names to load, in cascading order    editor   autoIndent: Enable/disable basic auto-indent (defaults to true)  nonWordCharacters: A string of non-word characters to define word boundaries  fontSize: The editor font size  fontFamily: The editor font family  invisibles: A hash of characters Atom will use to render whitespace characters. Keys are whitespace character types, values are rendered characters (use value false to turn off individual whitespace character types)   tab: Hard tab characters  cr: Carriage return (for Microsoft-style line endings)  eol: \\n characters  space: Leading and trailing space characters    preferredLineLength: Identifies the length of a line (defaults to 80)  showInvisibles: Whether to render placeholders for invisible characters (defaults to false)  showIndentGuide: Show/hide indent indicators within the editor  showLineNumbers: Show/hide line numbers within the gutter  softWrap: Enable/disable soft wrapping of text within the editor  softWrapAtPreferredLineLength: Enable/disable soft line wrapping at preferredLineLength   tabLength: Number of spaces within a tab (defaults to 2)    fuzzyFinder   ignoredNames: Files to ignore only in the fuzzy-finder    whitespace   ensureSingleTrailingNewline: Whether to reduce multiple newlines to one at the end of files  removeTrailingWhitespace: Enable/disable stripping of whitespace at the end of lines (defaults to true)    wrap-guide   columns: Array of hashes with a pattern and column key to match the path of the current editor to a column position.     Language Specific Configuration Settings You can also set several configuration settings differently for different file types. For example, you may want Atom to soft wrap markdown files, have two-space tabs for ruby files, and four-space tabs for python files. There are several settings now scoped to an editor's language. Here is the current list: editor.autoIndent editor.autoIndentOnPaste editor.invisibles editor.nonWordCharacters editor.preferredLineLength editor.scrollPastEnd editor.showIndentGuide editor.showInvisibles editor.softWrap editor.softWrapAtPreferredLineLength editor.softWrapHangingIndent editor.tabLength   Language-specific Settings in the Settings View You can edit these config settings in the Settings View on a per-language basis. Click on \"Packages\" tab in the navigation bar on the left, search for the language of your choice, select it, and edit away!   Language-specific Settings in your Config File You can also edit the config.cson directly. To open your configuration file via the Command Palette, press Cmd+Shift+PCtrl+Shift+P type open config, and press Enter. Global settings are under the * key, and each language can have its own top-level key. This key is the language's scope. Language-specific settings take precedence over anything set in the global section for that language only. '*': # all languages unless overridden  'editor': 'softWrap': false 'tabLength': 8 '.source.gfm': # markdown overrides  'editor': 'softWrap': true '.source.ruby': # ruby overrides  'editor': 'tabLength': 2 '.source.python': # python overrides  'editor': 'tabLength': 4   Finding a Language's Scope Name In order to write these overrides effectively, you'll need to know the scope name for the language. We've already done this for finding a scope for writing a snippet in Snippet Format, but we can quickly cover it again. The scope name is shown in the settings view for each language. Click on \"Packages\" in the navigation on the left, search for the language of your choice, select it, and you should see the scope name under the language name heading:  Another way to find the scope for a specific language is to open a file of its kind and press Alt+Cmd+PAlt+Ctrl+Shift+P to show all scopes for the current position of the cursor. The scope mentioned top most is always the language for this kind of file, the scopes following are specific to the cursor position:  These scopes can be especially useful to style the editor, since they can also be used as class names in your stylesheet.  Customizing Language Recognition If you want Atom to always recognize certain file types as a specific grammar, you'll need to manually edit your config.cson file. You can open it using the Application: Open Your Config command from the Command Palette. For example, if you wanted to add the foo extension to the CoffeeScript language, you could add this to your configuration file under the *.core section: '*' core: customFileTypes: 'source.coffee': [ 'foo' ]  In the example above, source.coffee is the language's scope name (see Finding a Language's Scope Name for more information) and foo is the file extension to match without the period. Adding a period to the beginning of either of these will not work.  Controlling Where Customization is Stored to Simplify Your Workflow The CSON configuration files for Atom are stored on disk on your machine. The location for this storage is customizable. The default is to use the home directory of the user executing the application. The Atom Home directory will, by default, be called .atom and will be located in the root of the home directory of the user.  Custom home location with an environment variable An environment variable can be used, though to make Atom use a different location. This can be useful for several reasons. One of these may be that multiple user accounts on a machine want to use the same Atom Home. The environment variable used to specify and alternate location is called ATOM_HOME. If this environment variable exists, the location specified will be used to load and store Atom settings.  Taking your customization with you with Portable Mode In addition to using the ATOM_HOME environment variable, Atom can also be set to use \"Portable Mode\". Portable Mode is most useful for taking Atom with you, with all your custom setting and packages, from machine to machine. This may take the form of keeping Atom on a USB drive or a cloud storage platform that syncs folders to different machines, like Dropbox. Atom is in Portable Mode when there is a directory named .atom sibling to the directory in which the atom executable file lives. For example, the installed Atom directory can be placed into a Dropbox folder next to a .atom folder.  With such a setup, Atom will use the same Home directory with the same settings for any machine with this directory syncronized/plugged in.  Moving to Portable Mode Atom provides a command-line parameter option for setting Portable Mode.  atom --portable  Executing atom with the --portable option will take the .atom directory you have in the default location (~/.atom) and copy the relevant contents for your configuration to a new home directory in the Portable Mode location. This enables easily moving from the default location to a portable operation without losing the customization you have already set up.",

Cmd+FCtrl+F - Search within a buffer  Cmd+Shift+FCtrl+Shift+F - Search the entire project  If you launch either of those commands, you'll be greeted with the Find and Replace panel at the bottom of your screen.  To search within your current file you can press Cmd+FCtrl+F, type in a search string and press Enter (or Cmd+GF3 or the \"Find Next\" button) multiple times to cycle through all the matches in that file. The Find and Replace panel also contains buttons for toggling case sensitivity, performing regular expression matching and scoping the search to selections. If you type a string in the replacement text box, you can replace matches with a different string. For example, if you wanted to replace every instance of the string \"Scott\" with the string \"Dragon\", you would enter those values in the two text boxes and press the \"Replace All\" button to perform the replacements. You can also find and replace throughout your entire project if you invoke the panel with Cmd+Shift+FCtrl+Shift+F.

Click on the matching line to jump to that location in that file. You can limit a search to a subset of the files in your project by entering a glob pattern into the \"File/Directory pattern\" text box. For example, the pattern src/*.js would restrict the search to javascript files in the src directory. The \"globstar\" pattern (**) can be used to match arbitrarily many subdirectories. For example, docs/**/*.md will match docs/a/foo.md, docs/a/b/foo.md, etc. When you have multiple project folders open, this feature can also be used to search in only one of those folders. For example, if you had the folders /path1/folder1 and /path2/folder2 open, you could enter a pattern starting with folder1 to search only in the first folder.

Most often this is done in some sort of markup language such as Asciidoc or Markdown (in which this manual is written). Here we'll quickly cover a few of the tools Atom provides for helping you write prose. In these docs, we'll concentrate on writing in Markdown; however, other prose markup languages like Asciidoc have packages that provide similar functionality.  Spell Checking If you're working in text (which includes plain text files, GitHub markdown, and Git commit messages by default), Atom will automatically try to check your spelling. Any misspelled words will be highlighted (by default with a dashed red line beneath the word), and you can pull up a menu of possible corrections by hitting Cmd+Shift+;Ctrl+Shift+; (or by choosing \"Correct Spelling\" from the right-click context menu or from the Command Palette).  To add more types of files to the list of what Atom will try to spell check, go to the Spell Check package settings in your Settings view and add any grammars you want to spell check. The default grammars to spell check are text.plain, source.gfm, and text.git-commit but you can add something like source.asciidoc if you wish to check those types of files too. The spell checking is implemented in the spell-check package.  Previews When writing prose in a markup language, it's often very useful to get an idea of what the content will look like when it's rendered. Atom ships with a package for previewing Markdown by default.   Ctrl+Shift+M - Will toggle Preview mode for Markdown.   As you edit the text, the preview will also update automatically. This makes it fairly easy to check your syntax as you type. You can also copy the rendered HTML from the preview pane into your system clipboard. There is no keybinding for it, but you can find it in the Command Palette by searching for \"Markdown Preview Copy HTML\". Markdown preview is implemented in the markdown-preview package.  Snippets There are also a number of great snippets available for writing Markdown quickly. If you type img and hit tab you get a Markdown-formatted image embed code like ![](). If you type table and hit tab you get a nice example table to fill out. | Header One | Header Two | | :------------- | :------------- | | Item One | Item Two |  Although there are only a handful of Markdown snippets (b for bold, i for italic, code for a code block, etc), they save you from having to look up the more obscure syntaxes.

          "body": " Version Control in Atom Version control is an important aspect of any project and Atom comes with basic Git and GitHub integration built in. In order to use version control in Atom, the project root needs to contain the Git repository.  Checkout HEAD revision The Alt+Cmd+ZAlt+Ctrl+Z keybinding checks out the HEAD revision of the file in the editor. This is a quick way to discard any saved and staged changes you've made and restore the file to the version in the HEAD commit. This is essentially the same as running git checkout HEAD -- &lt;path&gt; and git reset HEAD -- &lt;path&gt; from the command line for that path.  This command goes onto the undo stack so you can use Cmd+ZCtrl+Z afterwards to restore the previous contents.  Git status list Atom ships with the fuzzy-finder package which provides Cmd+TCtrl+T to quickly open files in the project and Cmd+BCtrl+B to jump to any open editor. The package also provides Cmd+Shift+BCtrl+Shift+B which displays a list of all the untracked and modified files in the project. These will be the same files that you would see on the command line if you ran git status.  An icon will appear to the right of each file letting you know whether it is untracked or modified.  Commit editor Atom can be used as your Git commit editor and ships with the language-git package which adds syntax highlighting to edited commit, merge, and rebase messages.  You can configure Atom to be your Git commit editor with the following command:  git config --global core.editor \"atom --wait\"  The language-git package will help remind you to be brief by colorizing the first lines of commit messages when they're longer than 50 or 65 characters.  Status bar icons The status-bar package that ships with Atom includes several Git decorations that display on the right side of the status bar:  The currently checked out branch name is shown with the number of commits the branch is ahead of or behind its upstream branch. An icon is added if the file is untracked, modified, or ignored. The number of lines added and removed since the file was last committed will be displayed as well.  Line diffs The included git-diff package colorizes the gutter next to lines that have been added, edited, or removed.  This package also adds Alt+G Down and Alt+G Up keybindings that allow you to move the cursor to the next or previous diff in the current editor.  Open on GitHub If the project you're working on is on GitHub, there are also some very useful integrations you can use. Most of the commands will take the current file you're viewing and open a view of that file on GitHub - for instance, the blame or commit history of that file.   Alt+G O - Open file on GitHub  Alt+G B - Open Blame view of file on GitHub  Alt+G H - Open History view of file on GitHub  Alt+G C - Copy the URL of the current file on GitHub to the clipboard  Alt+G R - Branch compare on GitHub  The branch comparison shows you the commits that are on the branch you're currently working on locally that are not on the mainline branch.

Atom ships with many of the basic Emacs keybindings for navigating a document. To go up and down a single character, you can use Ctrl+P and Ctrl+N. To go left and right a single character, you can use Ctrl+B and Ctrl+F. These are the equivalent of using the arrow keys, though some people prefer not having to move their hands to where the arrow keys are located on their keyboard. In addition to single character movement, there are a number of other movement keybindings:   Atom has support for all the standard Windows cursor movement key combinations. To go up, down, left or right a single character you can use the arrow keys. In addition to single character movement, there are a number of other movement keybindings:   Atom has support for all the standard Linux cursor movement key combinations. To go up, down, left or right a single character you can use the arrow keys. In addition to single character movement, there are a number of other movement keybindings:    Alt+Left or Alt+BCtrl+Left - Move to the beginning of word  Alt+Right or Alt+FCtrl+Right - Move to the end of word  Cmd+Left or Ctrl+AHome - Move to the first character of the current line  Cmd+Right or Ctrl+EEnd - Move to the end of the line  Cmd+UpCtrl+Home - Move to the top of the file  Cmd+DownCtrl+End - Move to the bottom of the file  You can also move directly to a specific line (and column) number with Ctrl+G. This will bring up a dialog that asks which line you would like to jump to. You can also use the row:column syntax to jump to a character in that line as well.   Navigating by Symbols You can also jump around a little more informatively with the Symbols View. To jump to a symbol such as a method definition, press Cmd+RCtrl+R. This opens a list of all symbols in the current file, which you can fuzzy filter similarly to Cmd+TCtrl+T. You can also search for symbols across your project but it requires a tags file.  You can generate a tags file by using the ctags utility. Once it is installed, you can use it to generate a tags file by running a command to generate it. See the ctags documentation for details. Once you have your tags file generated, you can use it to search for symbols across your project by pressing Cmd+Shift+RCtrl+Shift+R. This also enables you to use Alt+Cmd+DownAlt+Ctrl+Down to go to and Alt+Cmd+UpAlt+Ctrl+Up to return from the declaration of the symbol under the cursor. You can customize how tags are generated by creating your own .ctags file in your home directory, ~/.ctags%USERPROFILE%\\.ctags. An example can be found here. The symbols navigation functionality is implemented in the symbols-view package.  Bookmarks Atom also has a great way to bookmark specific lines in your project so you can jump back to them quickly. If you press Cmd+F2Alt+Ctrl+F2Ctrl+Shift+F2, Atom will toggle a \"bookmark\" on the current line. You can set these throughout your project and use them to quickly find and jump to important lines of your project. A small bookmark symbol is added to the line gutter, like on line 22 of the image below. If you hit F2, Atom will jump to the next bookmark in the file you currently have focused. If you use Shift+F2 it will cycle backwards through them instead. You can also see a list of all your project's current bookmarks and quickly filter them and jump to any of them by hitting Ctrl+F2.   The bookmarks functionality is implemented in the bookmarks package.",

Many Core and Community packages come bundled with their own snippets that are specific to it. For example, the language-html package that provides support for HTML syntax highlighting and grammar comes with dozens of snippets to create many of the various HTML tags you might want to use. If you create a new HTML file in Atom, you can type html and then press Tab and it will expand to: &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt;  It will also position the cursor in the middle of the title tag so you can immediately start filling out the tag. Many snippets have multiple focus points that you can move through with the Tab key as well - for instance, in the case of this HTML snippet, once you've filled out the title tag you can press Tab and the cursor will move to the middle of the body tag. To see all the available snippets for the file type that you currently have open, you can type Alt+Shift+S.  You can also use fuzzy search to filter this list down by typing in the selection box. Selecting one of them will execute the snippet where your cursor is (or multiple cursors are).  Creating Your Own Snippets So that's pretty cool, but what if there is something the language package didn't include or something that is custom to the code you write? Luckily it's incredibly easy to add your own snippets. There is a text file in your ~/.atom%USERPROFILE%\\.atom directory called snippets.cson that contains all your custom snippets that are loaded when you launch Atom. You can also easily open up that file by selecting the Atom &gt; SnippetsEdit &gt; SnippetsFile &gt; Snippets menu.  Snippet Format So let's look at how to write a snippet. The basic snippet format looks like this: '.source.js': 'console.log': 'prefix': 'log' 'body': 'console.log(${1:\"crash\"});$2'  The leftmost keys are the selectors where these snippets should be active. The easiest way to determine what this should be is to go to the language package of the language you want to add a snippet for and look for the \"Scope\" string. For example, if we wanted to add a snippet that would work for Java files, we would look up the language-java package in our Settings view and we can see the Scope is source.java. Then the top level snippet key would be that prepended by a period (like a CSS class selector would do).  The next level of keys are the snippet names. These are used for describing the snippet in a more readable way in the snippet menu. You can name them whatever you want. Under each snippet name is a prefix that should trigger the snippet and a body to insert when the snippet is triggered. Each $ followed by a number is a tab stop. Tab stops are cycled through by pressing Tab once a snippet has been triggered. Tab stops with the same number will create multiple cursors. The above example adds a log snippet to JavaScript files that would expand to: console.log(\"crash\");  The string \"crash\" would be initially selected and pressing tab again would place the cursor after the ;  Snippet keys, unlike CSS selectors, can only be repeated once per level. If there are duplicate keys at the same level, then only the last one will be read. See Configuring with CSON for more information.   Multi-line Snippet Body You can also use CoffeeScript multi-line syntax using \"\"\" for larger templates: '.source.js': 'if, else if, else': 'prefix': 'ieie' 'body': \"\"\" if (${1:true}) { $2 } else if (${3:false}) { $4 } else { $5 } \"\"\"  As you might expect, there is a snippet to create snippets. If you open up a snippets file and type snip and then press Tab, you will get the following text inserted: '.source.js': 'Snippet Name': 'prefix': 'hello' 'body': 'Hello World!'   just fill that bad boy out and you have yourself a snippet. As soon as you save the file, Atom should reload the snippets and you will immediately be able to try it out.  Multiple Snippets per Source You can see below the format for including multiple snippets for the same scope in your snippets.cson file. Just include the snippet name, prefix, and body keys for additional snippets inside the scope key: '.text.md': 'Hello World': 'prefix': 'hewo' 'body': 'Hello World!' 'Github Hello': 'prefix': 'gihe' 'body': 'Octocat says Hi!' 'Octocat Image Link': 'prefix': 'octopic' 'body': '![GitHub Octocat](https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/modules/logos_page/Octocat.png)'  Again, see Configuring with CSON for more information on CSON key structure and non-repeatability.  More Info The snippets functionality is implemented in the snippets package. For more examples, see the snippets in the language-html and language-javascript packages.",

          "body": " Atom Packages First we'll start with the Atom package system. As we mentioned previously, Atom itself is a very basic core of functionality that ships with a number of useful packages that add new features like the Tree View and the Settings View. In fact, there are more than 90 packages that comprise all of the functionality that is available in Atom by default. For example, the Welcome screen that you see when you first start Atom, the spell checker, the themes and the Fuzzy Finder are all packages that are separately maintained and all use the same APIs that you have access to, as we'll see in great detail in Hacking Atom. This means that packages can be incredibly powerful and can change everything from the very look and feel of the entire interface to the basic operation of even core functionality. In order to install a new package, you can use the Install tab in the now familiar Settings View. Open up the Settings View using Cmd+,Ctrl+,, click on the \"Install\" tab and type your search query into the box under Install Packages. The packages listed here have been published to http://atom.io/packages which is the official registry for Atom packages. Searching on the Settings View will go to the Atom package registry and pull in anything that matches your search terms.  All of the packages will come up with an \"Install\" button. Clicking that will download the package and install it. Your editor will now have the functionality that the package provides.  Package Settings Once a package is installed in Atom, it will show up in the Settings View under the \"Packages\" tab, along with all the preinstalled packages that come with Atom. To filter the list in order to find one, you can type into search box directly under the \"Installed Packages\" heading.  Clicking on the \"Settings\" button for a package will give you the settings screen for that package specifically. Here you have the option of changing some of the default variables for the package, seeing what all the command keybindings are, disabling the package temporarily, looking at the source code, seeing the current version of the package, reporting issues and uninstalling the package. If a new version of any of your packages is released, Atom will automatically detect it and you can upgrade the package from either this screen or from the \"Updates\" tab. This helps you easily keep all your installed packages up to date.  Atom Themes You can also find and install new themes for Atom from the Settings View. These can be either UI themes or syntax themes and you can search for them from the \"Install\" tab, just like searching for new packages. Make sure to press the \"Themes\" toggle next to the search box.  Clicking on the theme title will take you to a profile page for the theme on atom.io, which often has a screenshot of the theme. This way you can see what it looks like before installing it. Clicking on \"Install\" will install the theme and make it available in the Theme dropdowns as we saw in Changing the Theme.   Command Line You can also install packages or themes from the command line using apm.  Check that you have apm installed by running the following command in your terminal:  apm help install  You should see a message print out with details about the apm install command. If you do not, see the Installing Atom section for instructions on how to install the atom and apm commands for your system.  You can also install packages by using the apm install command:   apm install &lt;package_name&gt; to install the latest version.  apm install &lt;package_name&gt;@&lt;package_version&gt; to install a specific version.  For example apm install emmet@0.1.5 installs the 0.1.5 release of the Emmet package. You can also use apm to find new packages to install. If you run apm search, you can search the package registry for a search term.  apm search coffee Search Results For 'coffee' (5) ├── coffee-trace Add smart trace statements to coffee files with one keypress each.

          "body": " Editing and Deleting Text So far we've looked at a number of ways to move around and select regions of a file, so now let's actually change some of that text. Obviously you can type in order to insert characters, but there are also a number of ways to delete and manipulate text that could come in handy.  Basic Manipulation There are a handful of cool keybindings for basic text manipulation that might come in handy. These range from moving around lines of text and duplicating lines to changing the case.   Cmd+JCtrl+J - Join the next line to the end of the current line  Cmd+Ctrl+Up/DownCtrl+Up/Down - Move the current line up or down  Cmd+Shift+DCtrl+Shift+D - Duplicate the current line  Cmd+K Cmd+UCtrl+K Ctrl+U - Upper case the current word  Cmd+K Cmd+LCtrl+K Ctrl+L - Lower case the current word     Ctrl+T - Transpose characters. This swaps the two characters on either side of the cursor.   Atom also has built in functionality to re-flow a paragraph to hard-wrap at a given maximum line length. You can format the current selection to have lines no longer than 80 (or whatever number editor.preferredLineLength is set to) characters using Alt+Cmd+QAlt+Ctrl+Q. If nothing is selected, the current paragraph will be reflowed.  Deleting and Cutting You can also delete or cut text out of your buffer with some shortcuts. Be ruthless.   Ctrl+Shift+K - Delete current line  Alt+Backspace or Alt+HCtrl+Backspace - Delete to beginning of word  Alt+Delete or Alt+DCtrl+Delete - Delete to end of word     Cmd+Delete - Delete to end of line  Ctrl+K - Cut to end of line  Cmd+Backspace - Delete to beginning of line    Multiple Cursors and Selections One of the cool things that Atom can do out of the box is support multiple cursors. This can be incredibly helpful in manipulating long lists of text.   Cmd+ClickCtrl+Click - Add a new cursor at the clicked location  Ctrl+Shift+Up/DownAlt+Ctrl+Up/DownAlt+Shift+Up/Down - Add another cursor above/below the current cursor  Cmd+DCtrl+D - Select the next word in the document that is the same as the currently selected word  Cmd+Ctrl+GAlt+F3 - Select all words in the document that are the same as the currently selected word     Cmd+Shift+L - Convert a multi-line selection into multiple cursors   Using these commands you can place cursors in multiple places in your document and effectively execute the same commands in multiple places at once.  This can be incredibly helpful in doing many type of repetitive tasks such as renaming variables or changing the format of some text. You can use this with almost any plugin or command - for example, changing case and moving or duplicating lines. You can also use the mouse to select text with the CmdCtrl key pressed down to select multiple regions of your text simultaneously.  Whitespace Atom comes with several commands to help you manage the whitespace in your document. One very useful pair of commands converts leading spaces into tabs and converts leading tabs into spaces. If you're working with a document that has mixed whitespace, these commands are great for helping to normalize the file. There are no keybindings for the whitespace commands, so you will have to search your command palette for \"Convert Spaces to Tabs\" (or vice versa) to run one of these commands. The whitespace commands are implemented in the atom/whitespace package. The settings for the whitespace commands are managed on the page for the whitespace package.   The \"Remove Trailing Whitespace\" option is on by default. This means that every time you save any file opened in Atom, it will strip all trailing whitespace from the file. If you want to disable this, go to the whitespace package in your settings panel and uncheck that option.  Atom will also by default ensure that your file has a trailing newline. You can also disable this option on that screen.  Brackets Atom ships with intelligent and easy to use bracket handling. It will by default highlight [], (), and {} style brackets when your cursor is over them. It will also highlight matching XML and HTML tags. Atom will also automatically autocomplete [], (), and {}, \"\", '', “”, ‘’, «», ‹›, and backticks when you type the leading one. If you have a selection and you type any of these opening brackets or quotes, Atom will enclose the selection with the opening and closing brackets or quotes. There are a few other interesting bracket related commands that you can use.   Ctrl+M - Jump to the bracket matching the one adjacent to the cursor. It jumps to the nearest enclosing bracket when there's no adjacent bracket.  Cmd+Ctrl+MAlt+Ctrl+M - Select all the text inside the current brackets  Alt+Cmd+.Alt+Ctrl+. - Close the current XML/HTML tag  The brackets functionality is implemented in the bracket-matcher package. Like all of these packages, to change defaults related to bracket handling, or to disable it entirely, you can navigate to this package in the Settings view.  Encoding Atom also ships with some basic file encoding support should you find yourself working with non-UTF-8 encoded files, or should you wish to create one.   Ctrl+Shift+UAlt+U - Toggle menu to change file encoding  If you pull up the file encoding dialog, you can choose an alternate file encoding to save your file in. When you open a file, Atom will try to auto-detect the encoding. If Atom can't identify the encoding, the encoding will default to UTF-8, which is also the default encoding for new files.  If you pull up the encoding menu and change the active encoding to something else, the file will be written out in that encoding the next time you save the file. The encoding selector is implemented in the encoding-selector package.",

In this guide you will learn how to migrate your theme or package.  Summary Here a quick summary to see all the changes at a glance:    Before +/- After     atom-text-editor::shadow {} - ::shadow  atom-text-editor {}   .class /deep/ .class {} - /deep/  .class .class {}   atom-text-editor, :host {} - :host  atom-text-editor {}   .comment {} + .syntax--  .syntax--comment {}    Below you'll find more detailed examples.  UI themes and packages  ::shadow  Remove the ::shadow pseudo-element selector from atom-text-editor. Before: atom-text-editor::shadow .cursor { border-color: hotpink; }  After: atom-text-editor .cursor { border-color: hotpink; }   /deep/  Remove the /deep/ combinator selector. It didn't get used that often, mainly to customize the scrollbars. Before: .scrollbars-visible-always /deep/ ::-webkit-scrollbar { width: 8px; height: 8px; }  After: .scrollbars-visible-always ::-webkit-scrollbar { width: 8px; height: 8px; }   Syntax themes  :host  Remove the :host pseudo-element selector. To scope any styles to the text editor, using atom-text-editor is already enough. Before: atom-text-editor, :host { .cursor { border-color: hotpink; } }  After: atom-text-editor { .cursor { border-color: hotpink; } }   syntax--  Add a syntax-- prefix to all grammar selectors used by language packages. It looks a bit verbose, but it will protect all the grammar selectors from accidental style pollution. Before: .comment { color: @mono-3; font-style: italic; .markup.link { color: @mono-3; } }  After: .syntax--comment { color: @mono-3; font-style: italic; .syntax--markup.syntax--link { color: @mono-3; } }  Note: Selectors like the .gutter, .indent-guide, .cursor among others, that are also part of Syntax themes, don't need a prefix. Only grammar selectors that get used by language packages. For example .syntax--keyword, .syntax--keyword.syntax--operator.syntax--js.  Context-Targeted Style Sheets Atom also allowed you to target a specific shadow DOM context with an entire style sheet by adding .atom-text-editor to the file name. This is now not necessary anymore and can be removed. Before: my-ui-theme/ styles/ index.atom-text-editor.less  After: my-ui-theme/ styles/ index.less   I followed the guide, but now my styling is broken! By replacing atom-text-editor::shadow with atom-text-editor.editor, specificity might have changed. This can cause the side effect that some of your properties won't be strong enough. To fix that, you can increase specificity on your selector. A simple way is to just repeat your class (in the example below it's .my-class): Before: atom-text-editor::shadow .my-class { color: hotpink; }  After: atom-text-editor .my-class.my-class { color: hotpink; }   When should I migrate my theme/package?  If you already want to test the migration on master or Beta channel, make sure to change your package.json file to \"engines\": { \"atom\": \"&gt;=1.13.0 &lt;2.0.0\" }. This will prevent Atom from updating your theme or package before the user also updates Atom to version 1.13. Or you can wait until Atom 1.13 reaches Stable. Check blog.atom.io to see if 1.13 already has been released. Don't worry if you're a bit late, Atom will transform the deprecated selectors automatically to avoid breaking any themes or packages. But users will start to see a deprecation warning in deprecation-cop. ",

Upgrading Your UI Theme Or Package Selectors In addition to changes in Atom's scripting API, we'll also be making some breaking changes to Atom's DOM structure, requiring style sheets and keymaps in both packages and themes to be updated.  Deprecation Cop Deprecation Cop will list usages of deprecated selector patterns to guide you. You can access it via the Command Palette (cmd-shift-p, then search for Deprecation). It breaks the deprecations down by package:   Custom Tags Rather than adding classes to standard HTML elements to indicate their role, Atom now uses custom element names. For example, &lt;div class=\"workspace\"&gt; has now been replaced with &lt;atom-workspace&gt;. Selectors should be updated accordingly. Note that tag names have lower specificity than classes in CSS, so you'll need to take care in converting things.    Old Selector New Selector     .editor atom-text-editor   .editor.mini atom-text-editor[mini]   .workspace atom-workspace   .horizontal atom-workspace-axis.horizontal   .vertical atom-workspace-axis.vertical   .pane-container atom-pane-container   .pane atom-pane   .tool-panel atom-panel   .panel-top atom-panel.top   .panel-bottom atom-panel.bottom   .panel-left atom-panel.left   .panel-right atom-panel.right   .overlay atom-panel.modal     Supporting the Shadow DOM Text editor content is now rendered in the shadow DOM, which shields it from being styled by global style sheets to protect against accidental style pollution. For more background on the shadow DOM, check out the Shadow DOM 101 on HTML 5 Rocks. If you need to style text editor content in a UI theme, you'll need to circumvent this protection for any rules that target the text editor's content. Some examples of the kinds of UI theme styles needing to be updated:  Highlight decorations Gutter decorations Line decorations Scrollbar styling Anything targeting a child selector of .editor   During a transition phase, it will be possible to enable or disable the text editor's shadow DOM in the settings, so themes will need to be compatible with both approaches.  Shadow DOM Selectors Chromium provides two tools for bypassing shadow boundaries, the ::shadow pseudo-element and the /deep/ combinator. For an in-depth explanation of styling the shadow DOM, see the Shadow DOM 201 article on HTML 5 Rocks.  ::shadow  The ::shadow pseudo-element allows you to bypass a single shadow root. For example, say you want to update a highlight decoration for a linter package. Initially, the style looks as follows: // Without shadow DOM support atom-text-editor .highlight.my-linter { background: hotpink; }  In order for this style to apply with the shadow DOM enabled, you will need to add a second selector with the ::shadow pseudo-element. You should leave the original selector in place so your theme continues to work with the shadow DOM disabled during the transition period. // With shadow DOM support atom-text-editor .highlight.my-linter, atom-text-editor::shadow .highlight.my-linter { background: hotpink; }  Check out the find-and-replace package for another example of using ::shadow to pierce the shadow DOM.  /deep/  The /deep/ combinator overrides all shadow boundaries, making it useful for rules you want to apply globally such as scrollbar styling. Here's a snippet containing scrollbar styling for the Atom Dark UI theme before shadow DOM support: // Without shadow DOM support .scrollbars-visible-always { ::-webkit-scrollbar { width: 8px; height: 8px; } ::-webkit-scrollbar-track, ::-webkit-scrollbar-corner { background: @scrollbar-background-color; } ::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb { background: @scrollbar-color; border-radius: 5px; box-shadow: 0 0 1px black inset; } }  To style scrollbars even inside of the shadow DOM, each rule needs to be prefixed with /deep/. We use /deep/ instead of ::shadow because we don't care about the selector of the host element in this case. We just want our styling to apply everywhere. // With shadow DOM support using /deep/ .scrollbars-visible-always { /deep/ ::-webkit-scrollbar { width: 8px; height: 8px; } /deep/ ::-webkit-scrollbar-track, /deep/ ::-webkit-scrollbar-corner { background: @scrollbar-background-color; } /deep/ ::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb { background: @scrollbar-color; border-radius: 5px; box-shadow: 0 0 1px black inset; } }   Context-Targeted Style Sheets The selector features discussed above allow you to target shadow DOM content with specific selectors, but Atom also allows you to target a specific shadow DOM context with an entire style sheet. The context into which a style sheet is loaded is based on the file name. If you want to load a style sheet into the editor, name it with the .atom-text-editor.less or .atom-text-editor.css extensions. my-ui-theme/ styles/ index.less # loaded globally index.atom-text-editor.less # loaded in the text editor shadow DOM  Check out this style sheet from the decoration-example package for an example of context-targeting. Inside a context-targeted style sheet, there's no need to use the ::shadow or /deep/ expressions. If you want to refer to the element containing the shadow root, you can use the ::host pseudo-element. During the transition phase, style sheets targeting the atom-text-editor context will also be loaded globally. Make sure you update your selectors in a way that maintains compatibility with the shadow DOM being disabled. That means if you use a ::host pseudo element, you should also include the same style rule matches against atom-text-editor.",

TL;DR We've set deprecation messages and errors in strategic places to help make sure you don't miss anything. You should be able to get 95% of the way to an updated package just by fixing errors and deprecations. There are a couple of things you can do to get the full effect of all the errors and deprecations.  Use atom-space-pen-views If you use any class from require 'atom' with a $ or View in the name, add the atom-space-pen-views module to your package's package.json file's dependencies: { \"dependencies\": { \"atom-space-pen-views\": \"^2.0.3\" } }  Then run apm install in your package directory.  Require views from atom-space-pen-views Anywhere you are requiring one of the following from atom you need to require them from atom-space-pen-views instead. # require these from 'atom-space-pen-views' rather than 'atom' $ $$ $$$ View TextEditorView ScrollView SelectListView  So this: # Old way {$, TextEditorView, View, GitRepository} = require 'atom'  Would be replaced by this: # New way {GitRepository} = require 'atom' {$, TextEditorView, View} = require 'atom-space-pen-views'   Run specs and test your package You wrote specs, right!? Here's where they shine. Run them with cmd-shift-P, and search for run package specs. It will show all the deprecation messages and errors.  Update the engines field When you are deprecation free and all done converting, upgrade the engines field in your package.json: { \"engines\": { \"atom\": \"&gt;=0.174.0 &lt;2.0.0\" } }   Examples We have upgraded all the core packages. Please see this issue for a link to all the upgrade PRs.  Deprecations All of the methods in Atom core that have changes will emit deprecation messages when called. These messages are shown in two places: your package specs, and in Deprecation Cop.  Specs Just run your specs, and all the deprecations will be displayed in yellow.   Note: Deprecations are only displayed when executing specs through the \"Window: Run Package Specs\" command in the Atom UI. Deprecations are not displayed when running specs at the terminal.   Deprecation Cop Run Atom in Dev Mode, atom --dev, with your package loaded, and open Deprecation Cop (search for \"deprecation\" in the command palette). Deprecated methods will appear in Deprecation Cop only after they have been called.  When Deprecation Cop is open, and deprecated methods are called, a Refresh button will appear in the top right of the Deprecation Cop interface. So exercise your package, then come back to Deprecation Cop and click the Refresh button.  Upgrading your Views Previous to 1.0, views were baked into Atom core. These views were based on jQuery and space-pen. They looked something like this: # The old way: getting views from atom {$, TextEditorView, View} = require 'atom' module.exports = class SomeView extends View @content: -&gt; @div class: 'find-and-replace', =&gt; @div class: 'block', =&gt; @subview 'myEditor', new TextEditorView(mini: true) #...   The New require 'atom' no longer provides view helpers or jQuery. Atom Core is now 'view agnostic'. The preexisting view system is available from a new Node module: atom-space-pen-views. atom-space-pen-views now provides jQuery, space-pen views, and Atom specific views: # These are now provided by atom-space-pen-views $ $$ $$$ View TextEditorView ScrollView SelectListView   Adding the module dependencies To use the new views, you need to specify the atom-space-pen-views module in your package's package.json file's dependencies: { \"dependencies\": { \"atom-space-pen-views\": \"^2.0.3\" } }  space-pen bundles jQuery. If you do not need space-pen or any of the views, you can require jQuery directly. { \"dependencies\": { \"jquery\": \"^2\" } }   Converting your views Sometimes it is as simple as converting the requires at the top of each view page. I assume you read the 'TL;DR' section and have updated all of your requires.  Upgrading classes extending any space-pen View  afterAttach and beforeRemove updated The afterAttach and beforeRemove hooks have been replaced with attached and detached and the semantics have changed. afterAttach was called whenever the node was attached to another DOM node, even if that parent node wasn't present in the DOM. afterAttach also was called with a boolean indicating whether or not the element and its parents were on the DOM. Now the attached hook is only called when the node and all of its parents are actually on the DOM, and is not called with a boolean. beforeRemove was only called when $.fn.remove was called, which was typically used when the node was completely removed from the DOM. The new detached hook is called whenever the DOM node is detached, which could happen if the node is being detached for reattachment later. In short, if beforeRemove is called the node is never coming back. With detached it might be attached again later. # Old way {View} = require 'atom' class MyView extends View afterAttach: (onDom) -&gt; #...  beforeRemove: -&gt; #...  # New way {View} = require 'atom-space-pen-views' class MyView extends View attached: -&gt; # Always called with the equivalent of @afterAttach(true)!  #...  detached: -&gt; #...   subscribe and subscribeToCommand methods removed The subscribe and subscribeToCommand methods have been removed. See the Eventing and Disposables section for more info.  Upgrading to the new TextEditorView All of the atom-specific methods available on the TextEditorView have been moved to the TextEditor, available via TextEditorView::getModel. See the TextEditorView docs and TextEditor docs for more info.  Upgrading classes extending ScrollView The ScrollView has very minor changes. You can no longer use @off to remove default behavior for core:move-up, core:move-down, etc. # Old way to turn off default behavior class ResultsView extends ScrollView initialize: (@model) -&gt; super() # turn off default scrolling behavior from ScrollView  @off 'core:move-up' @off 'core:move-down' @off 'core:move-left' @off 'core:move-right'  # New way to turn off default behavior class ResultsView extends ScrollView initialize: (@model) -&gt; disposable = super() # turn off default scrolling behavior from ScrollView  disposable.dispose()   Check out an example from find-and-replace. See the docs for all the options.   Upgrading classes extending SelectListView Your SelectListView might look something like this: # Old! class CommandPaletteView extends SelectListView initialize: -&gt; super() @addClass('command-palette overlay from-top') atom.workspaceView.command 'command-palette:toggle', =&gt; @toggle() confirmed: ({name, jQuery}) -&gt; @cancel() # do something with the result  toggle: -&gt; if @hasParent() @cancel() else @attach() attach: -&gt; @storeFocusedElement() items = [] # TODO: build items  @setItems(items) atom.workspaceView.append(this) @focusFilterEditor() confirmed: ({name, jQuery}) -&gt; @cancel()  This attaches and detaches itself from the DOM when toggled, canceling magically detaches it from the DOM, and it uses the classes overlay and from-top. The new SelectListView no longer automatically detaches itself from the DOM when cancelled. It's up to you to implement whatever cancel behavior you want. Using the new APIs to mimic the semantics of the old class, it should look like this: # New! class CommandPaletteView extends SelectListView initialize: -&gt; super() # no more need for the `overlay` and `from-top` classes  @addClass('command-palette') atom.commands.add 'atom-workspace', 'command-palette:toggle', =&gt; @toggle() # You need to implement the `cancelled` method and hide.  cancelled: -&gt; @hide() confirmed: ({name, jQuery}) -&gt; @cancel() # do something with the result  toggle: -&gt; # Toggling now checks panel visibility,  # and hides / shows rather than attaching to / detaching from the DOM.  if @panel?.isVisible() @cancel() else @show() show: -&gt; # Now you will add your select list as a modal panel to the workspace  @panel ?= atom.workspace.addModalPanel(item: this) @panel.show() @storeFocusedElement() items = [] # TODO: build items  @setItems(items) @focusFilterEditor() hide: -&gt; @panel?.hide()   And check out the conversion of CommandPaletteView as a real-world example. See the SelectListView docs for all options.   Using the model layer rather than the view layer The API no longer exposes any specialized view objects or view classes. atom.workspaceView, and all the view classes: WorkspaceView, EditorView, PaneView, etc. have been globally deprecated. Nearly all of the atom-specific actions performed by the old view objects can now be managed via the model layer. For example, here's adding a panel to the interface using the atom.workspace model instead of the workspaceView: # Old! div = document.createElement('div') atom.workspaceView.appendToTop(div)  # New! div = document.createElement('div') atom.workspace.addTopPanel(item: div)  For actions that still require the view, such as dispatching commands or munging css classes, you'll access the view via the atom.views.getView() method. This will return a subclass of HTMLElement rather than a jQuery object or an instance of a deprecated view class (e.g. WorkspaceView). # Old! workspaceView = atom.workspaceView editorView = workspaceView.getActiveEditorView() paneView = editorView.getPaneView()  # New! # Generally, just use the models workspace = atom.workspace editor = workspace.getActiveTextEditor() pane = editor.getPane() # If you need views, get them with `getView` workspaceElement = atom.views.getView(atom.workspace) editorElement = atom.views.getView(editor) paneElement = atom.views.getView(pane)   Updating Specs atom.workspaceView, the WorkspaceView class and the EditorView class have been deprecated. These two objects are used heavily throughout specs, mostly to dispatch events and commands. This section will explain how to remove them while still retaining the ability to dispatch events and commands.  Removing WorkspaceView references WorkspaceView has been deprecated. Everything you could do on the view, you can now do on the Workspace model. Requiring WorkspaceView from atom and accessing any methods on it will throw a deprecation warning. Many specs lean heavily on WorkspaceView to trigger commands and fetch EditorView objects. Your specs might contain something like this: # Old! {WorkspaceView} = require 'atom' describe 'FindView', -&gt; beforeEach -&gt; atom.workspaceView = new WorkspaceView()  Instead, we will use the atom.views.getView() method. This will return a plain HTMLElement, not a WorkspaceView or jQuery object. # New! describe 'FindView', -&gt; workspaceElement = null beforeEach -&gt; workspaceElement = atom.views.getView(atom.workspace)   Attaching the workspace to the DOM The workspace needs to be attached to the DOM in some cases. For example, view hooks only work (attached() on View, attachedCallback() on custom elements) when there is a descendant attached to the DOM. You might see this in your specs: # Old! atom.workspaceView.attachToDom()  Change it to: # New! jasmine.attachToDOM(workspaceElement)   Removing EditorView references Like WorkspaceView, EditorView has been deprecated. Everything you needed to do on the view you are now able to do on the TextEditor model. In many cases, you will not even need to get the editor's view anymore. Any of those instances should be updated to use the TextEditor instance instead. You should really only need the editor's view when you plan on triggering a command on the view in a spec. Your specs might contain something like this: # Old! describe 'Something', -&gt; [editorView] = [] beforeEach -&gt; editorView = atom.workspaceView.getActiveView()  We're going to use atom.views.getView() again to get the editor element. As in the case of the workspaceElement, getView will return a subclass of HTMLElement rather than an EditorView or jQuery object. # New! describe 'Something', -&gt; [editor, editorElement] = [] beforeEach -&gt; editor = atom.workspace.getActiveTextEditor() editorElement = atom.views.getView(editor)   Dispatching commands Since the editorElement objects are no longer jQuery objects, they no longer support trigger(). Additionally, Atom has a new command dispatcher, atom.commands, that we use rather than commandeering jQuery's trigger method. From this: # Old! workspaceView.trigger 'a-package:toggle' editorView.trigger 'find-and-replace:show'  To this: # New! atom.commands.dispatch workspaceElement, 'a-package:toggle' atom.commands.dispatch editorElement, 'find-and-replace:show'   Eventing and Disposables A couple large things changed with respect to events:  All model events are now exposed as event subscription methods that return Disposable objects The subscribe() method is no longer available on space-pen View objects An Emitter is now provided from require 'atom'    Consuming Events All events from the Atom API are now methods that return a Disposable object, on which you can call dispose() to unsubscribe. # Old! editor.on 'changed', -&gt;  # New! disposable = editor.onDidChange -&gt; # You can unsubscribe at some point in the future via `dispose()` disposable.dispose()  Deprecation warnings will guide you toward the correct methods.  Using a CompositeDisposable  You can group multiple disposables into a single disposable with a CompositeDisposable. {CompositeDisposable} = require 'atom' class Something constructor: -&gt; editor = atom.workspace.getActiveTextEditor() @disposables = new CompositeDisposable @disposables.add editor.onDidChange -&gt; @disposables.add editor.onDidChangePath -&gt; destroy: -&gt; @disposables.dispose()   Removing View::subscribe and Subscriber::subscribe calls There were a couple permutations of subscribe(). In these examples, a CompositeDisposable is used as it will commonly be useful where conversion is necessary.  subscribe(unsubscribable)  This one is very straight forward. # Old! @subscribe editor.on 'changed', -&gt;  # New! disposables = new CompositeDisposable disposables.add editor.onDidChange -&gt;   subscribe(modelObject, event, method)  When the modelObject is an Atom model object, the change is very simple. Just use the correct event method, and add it to your CompositeDisposable. # Old! @subscribe editor, 'changed', -&gt;  # New! disposables = new CompositeDisposable disposables.add editor.onDidChange -&gt;   subscribe(jQueryObject, selector(optional), event, method)  Things are a little more complicated when subscribing to a DOM or jQuery element. Atom no longer provides helpers for subscribing to elements. You can use jQuery or the native DOM APIs, whichever you prefer. # Old! @subscribe $(window), 'focus', -&gt;  # New! {Disposable, CompositeDisposable} = require 'atom' disposables = new CompositeDisposable # New with jQuery focusCallback = -&gt; $(window).on 'focus', focusCallback disposables.add new Disposable -&gt; $(window).off 'focus', focusCallback # New with native APIs focusCallback = -&gt; window.addEventListener 'focus', focusCallback disposables.add new Disposable -&gt; window.removeEventListener 'focus', focusCallback   Providing Events: Using the Emitter  You no longer need to require emissary to get an emitter. We now provide an Emitter class from require 'atom'. We have a specific pattern for use of the Emitter. Rather than mixing it in, we instantiate a member variable, and create explicit subscription methods. For more information see the Emitter docs. # New! {Emitter} = require 'atom' class Something constructor: -&gt; @emitter = new Emitter destroy: -&gt; @emitter.dispose() onDidChange: (callback) -&gt; @emitter.on 'did-change', callback methodThatFiresAChange: -&gt; @emitter.emit 'did-change', {data: 2} # Using the evented class something = new Something something.onDidChange (eventObject) -&gt; console.log eventObject.data # =&gt; 2 something.methodThatFiresAChange()   Subscribing To Commands $.fn.command and View::subscribeToCommand are no longer available. Now we use atom.commands.add, and collect the results in a CompositeDisposable. See the docs for more info. # Old! atom.workspaceView.command 'core:close core:cancel', -&gt; # When inside a View class, you might see this @subscribeToCommand 'core:close core:cancel', -&gt;  # New! @disposables.add atom.commands.add 'atom-workspace', 'core:close': -&gt; 'core:cancel': -&gt; # You can register commands directly on individual DOM elements in addition to # using selectors. When in a View class, you should have a `@element` object # available. `@element` is a plain HTMLElement object @disposables.add atom.commands.add @element, 'core:close': -&gt; 'core:cancel': -&gt;   Upgrading your stylesheet's selectors Many selectors have changed, and we have introduced the Shadow DOM to the editor.

Upgrading Your Syntax Theme Text editor content is now rendered in the shadow DOM, which shields it from being styled by global style sheets to protect against accidental style pollution. For more background on the shadow DOM, check out the Shadow DOM 101 on HTML 5 Rocks. Syntax themes are specifically intended to style only text editor content, so they are automatically loaded directly into the text editor's shadow DOM when it is enabled. This happens automatically when the theme's package.json contains a theme: \"syntax\" declaration, so you don't need to change anything to target the appropriate context. When theme style sheets are loaded into the text editor's shadow DOM, selectors intended to target the editor from the outside no longer make sense. Styles targeting the .editor and .editor-colors classes instead need to target the :host pseudo-element, which matches against the containing atom-text-editor node. Check out the Shadow DOM 201 article for more information about the :host pseudo-element. Here's an example from Atom's light syntax theme. Note that the atom-text-editor selector intended to target the editor from the outside has been retained to allow the theme to keep working during the transition phase when it is possible to disable the shadow DOM. atom-text-editor, :host { /* :host added */ background-color: @syntax-background-color; color: @syntax-text-color; .invisible-character { color: @syntax-invisible-character-color; } /* more nested selectors... */ } ",
